LUMINOUS made a gallant entry into the K-Pop scene with their debut album in 2021, YOUTH, spearheaded by its title track, \u201cRUN\u201d. The project conveyed compassionate sentiments towards youth and their experiences. With the project, LUMINOUS\u2019 four members, Steven, Woobin, Suil, and Youngbin, charmed fans not only with their relatable music but also with their unique charisma as idols.  Though it was clear from their initial debut that the team boasted honed performance skills, the members showcase their growth in their newest project. Their second mini-album, Between Light and Darkness (Self n Ego), continues their youth series established with their debut project. With their comeback, LUMINOUS beckons listeners to focus on comparing the \u2018self\u2019 and \u2018ego\u2019, or in other words, the real and the fabricated. By doing so, LUMINOUS extends their exploration of the challenges that young people face. However, while the album and its title track \u201cAll eyes down (advance)\u201d may continue the themes of their prior project, LUMINOUS raises the stakes with their latest work. The members return fiercer than ever, delivering a mix of R&B, hip hop, and pop. Following their comeback with Between Light and Darkness (Self n Ego), LUMINOUS spoke to Hellokpop in an exclusive interview. We spoke about their production process, their own journey of youth, and more! Hellokpop (HKP):\u00a0Hi LUMINOUS, thank you for sharing your time with Hellokpop! Please introduce yourselves to our readers. LUMINOUS:\u00a0(Youngbin) \u2014 Hello, I\u2019m the leader and lead vocal of LUMINOUS, Youngbin. (Suil) \u2014 Hello, I\u2019m Suil and I handle dance, rap, and vocal in LUMINOUS. (Steven) \u2014 Hello, I\u2019m Steven and I handle rap and vocal in LUMINOUS. (Woobin) \u2014 Hello, I\u2019m Woobin and I\u2019m the youngest and the main vocalist of LUMINOUS. HKP:\u00a0Congratulations on your latest release with your second mini-album, Between Light and Darkness (Self n Ego)! What message do you hope your fans take away from your album? LUMINOUS:\u00a0In the second mini-album, we speak of \u2018youth\u2019 where we wander in search of direction and meaning in the life we\u2019ve chosen. We wanted to relate to and comfort similar-aged fans with similar worries as us, as well as people of broader and more diverse generations. We want to impart the message that you never know about the future, so we should never give up and move on even in the face of difficult moments. HKP: Your music video for your latest title track, \u201cAll Eyes Down\u201d, really showcases your incredible abilities as performers. Did you have any behind-the-scenes stories to share about the filming experience? LUMINOUS:\u00a0(Suil) \u2014 I had something that gave me goosebumps. I was doing some monitoring in the middle of individual filming in an eerie abandoned house, and the staff suddenly ran towards me asking if I called for them. I hadn\u2019t said anything.. It\u2019s still a mystery. (Woobin) \u2014 I had an individual scene where I smash a wall with a hammer. It was a real wall and not a prop, so I had to put more power behind it and worked hard to break it down. It was fun because I\u2019ve never done that before.  HKP: What is your favourite song on your latest album and why? LUMINOUS: (Youngbin) \u2014 \u201cWant it more?\u201d. The lyric \u2018Isn\u2019t there such a thing as perfect\u2019 is something I relate to. (Suil) \u2014 \u201cScintillation (Blind)\u201d. I relate to the idea of rushing toward dreams and goals even if it means burning up like a moth into fire. (Steven) \u2014 \u201cTrouble\u201d. Because I can express the freedom within me through this song. (Woobin) \u2014 \u201cScintillation (Blind)\u201d. This song in itself is about audacious and endless challenge, so I don\u2019t want to lose that mindset. HKP: Can you share what the production process for this project was like? What was the most memorable moment you had during its creation? LUMINOUS: Since this album was our first comeback, we think the preparation went by faster than our first album. A memorable thing is that we practiced to accentuate the feel of every track, and we had to learn the title track\u2019s choreography quickly so we practiced diligently. Album preparations seem to begin and end with practice.  HKP:\u00a0You\u2019ve shown a variety of different sides of LUMINOUS to your fans through your music. Is there a particular genre or concept you\u2019d like to tackle next? LUMINOUS: (Suil) \u2014 The songs I listen to these days are moombahton tracks, so if there\u2019s a chance I\u2019d like for us to try a moombahton track. (Youngbin) \u2014 The first and second albums were somewhat dark concepts, so I want to try a bright and refreshing concept at some point. HKP:\u00a0Since your debut, you\u2019ve been exploring the theme of youth. Can you share what you have learned about yourselves during your journey of youth so far? LUMINOUS:\u00a0(Youngbin) \u2014 My life motto is \u2018Live today to the best of my ability\u2019. Time never comes back so I realized I should live every day diligently. So I\u2019ve been feeling that mindset of living every day to the fullest again. (Woobin) \u2014 Through debuting and having a comeback, I\u2019ve learned that I can\u2019t live this life on my own, so we need to understand and help each other. HKP: Your music brings a lot of comfort to fans when they encounter challenges as young people. Do you have any advice to share on how to overcome difficult times? How have you been able to overcome hardships? LUMINOUS:\u00a0(Suil) \u2014 I think it would be good to take some personal time and think through things sufficiently, and then try to resolve the problem in your own way. (Woobin) \u2014 It\u2019d be good to think as much as possible through the hard times, and don\u2019t try to rush yourself back to being okay. HKP: LUMINOUS is a group that aims to bring light into the world and into your fans\u2019 lives, but what has been a heartwarming experience you have had as an artist where you felt the light of your fans? LUMINOUS:\u00a0When we\u2019re feeling low because we\u2019re dissatisfied with a performance, or exhausted from busy schedules, fans comfort and encourage us through letters or text, and in those times we feel that we receive light from our fans. HKP:\u00a0Since debuting, you have formed quite a strong bond as a team. Can you share something that you are most proud of about another member? LUMINOUS:\u00a0(Steven) \u2014 Woobin\u2019s husky voice is charming, but his high notes are very cool too. (Youngbin) \u2014 I think Steven\u2019s rap tone is very charming. I\u2019m really envious of the low tones that I don\u2019t have. HKP:\u00a0How do you think your dynamic as a group has changed since your debut up until now? LUMINOUS: First of all, we remember being shocked at receiving so much unexpected love from many people at our debut. While working hard for this comeback with a little sense of pressure, we had some doubts about whether we could receive as much love as during the debut, but we were really fascinated and proud to again receive attention and love from so many people and attain good results. HKP:\u00a0For newer fans, what do you think is the most charming point about LUMINOUS that stands out? LUMINOUS:\u00a0(Steven) \u2014\u00a0Idols you can rely on and listen to! I think it\u2019s our live singing, of course. (Youngbin) \u2014 I think it\u2019s the vocals and dance that have a distinct color across the four of us.  HKP:\u00a0What can fans look forward to from LUMINOUS this year? LUMINOUS: This year, we are preparing diverse content and performances so we can interact with many fans. We definitely want to meet with many fans if the COVID situation gets better. We are really preparing a lot of things, so please watch us! HKP:\u00a0What are your biggest goals, both personally and for the group, that you have for 2022? LUMINOUS: We think it has to be our song breaking into the charts and to repay the fans who love us, we really want to do a world tour. We want to show our music and performance in many countries. HKP:\u00a0Can you send a message of love to your global fans? LUMINOUS:\u00a0Hello fans, it\u2019s LUMINOUS. Our album was released after four months and thank you for waiting in the meantime. And thank you for loving and providing attention to this album as well.  We LUMINOUS will become artists that fans can be proud of, so please keep watching us for a long time, and loving us!

            "content": "Best shared with your friends and family, the series runs a dozen episodes only. Perfect for a scheduled binge watch. Trust me, the experience is life uplifting. K-Drama Review: \u201cThirty Nine\u201d Treasures Life-Affirming Journey With True Friends   Thirty Nine traces the story of three friends. They first met when they were 18. Cha Mi-jo (Son Ye Jin), Jung Chan-young (Jeon Mi Do) and Jang Joo-hee (Kim Ji Hyun) have shared beautiful moments together. However, an inevitable separation happens when Chan-young was diagnosed to be terminally ill. While spending the numbered days of being together, they also come to terms to find love and pursue personal dreams and closures. Along the way, the three friends have become part of each other. In their shared memories highlighted in the series, they left heartening lessons worth pondering. Life presents us with different kinds of friendship circles. But the most special and worth keeping are lifetime friends. They are the kind of friends that are willing to share meaningful memories. They give a kind of friendship that endures.  Touching on the topic of adoption, Thirty Nine provided an encouraging nod to influence people emotionally and financially capable of adoption. More than that, it significantly expounded on the definition of family. Through Mi-jo\u2019s story, the idea that a blood relationship can be outweighed by estrangement was emphasized. Correspondingly, the shared love and beautiful memories among a family that is not blood-related were underlined. Presenting heartfelt love stories, the couples featured in the series confronted problems before sealing their respective romantic relationships. Chan-young who was robbed of her one true love has to endure the thought that it soon will never last. While we understand Jin-suk\u2019s desire to be acknowledged as her husband, it was later implied by Chan-young how she doesn\u2019t care about binding papers. Likewise, Mi-jo who received a straightforward message from the father of the man she loves that he\u2019s not in favor of them being together accepts the opinion and respects it. But she remained firm on her love promise because she knows she was worthy enough to be with Sun-woo.  Whether it\u2019s trivial or monumental, it\u2019s nice to work on special projects in our lives. Thirty Nine\u2018s trio has incorporated their goals with each other in mind. As we grow older, we tend to lose interest in things or activities we used to like. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we always have something to look forward to. Joo-hee and Hyun-jun both aspire to have a lifetime career that can keep their sanity. Having had enough of the pressure of working as company employees, they brave the choice to go become the bosses of their jobs. Starting a new career at 40 could be a little daunting but life is too short to have a job that does not make you happy.  Life can be too short or too long to be explored depending on how you make it interesting each day. No need to fret if goals and love are not manifesting at some point in your life, there\u2019s always a right time for everything.  It\u2019s always a blessing to return the unconditional love our parents gave us. Those we know about and those that we don\u2019t know of. If resources permit us to dote on them, then, by all means, do it.  While it\u2019s hard to do this every time, finding the silver lining to moments of life setbacks is a lifetime commitment. We are the main actors in our own lives so we can always drive it to meaningful memories and happy endings. Not money or material things, but time and effort make our relationship with our friends and family thrive. Celebrate life and friendship in Thirty Nine.
