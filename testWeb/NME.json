            "title": "Pooh Shiesty sentenced to five years in prison over Florida shooting",
            "content": "Pooh Shiesty has been sentenced to five years in prison after pleading guilty to a single firearms conspiracy charge. The rapper \u2013 whose real name is Lontrell Donell Williams Jr. \u2013 was charged over his involvement in an October 2020 shooting at a hotel in Bay Harbor Islands in Florida. He is said to have shot a 28-year-old man in the buttocks. After Williams pleaded guilty to a single firearms conspiracy charge earlier this year, federal prosecutors dropped three additional charges that could have resulted in a lifetime prison sentence. The most serious of these charges alleged that Shiesty fired a gun during the confrontation at the Landon Hotel in Bay Harbor Islands on October 9, 2020. According to Stereogum, the rapper ultimately took a plea deal with prosecutors. He pleaded guilty to one federal charge of conspiracy to possess a firearm in furtherance of violent and drug-trafficking crimes, in exchange for the three other charges being dropped. Williams has now been sentenced to 63 months \u2013 which is equal to five years and three months \u2013 rather than the 97 months he had been facing with the three extra charges taken into account. \u201cListen, nobody\u2019s happy to go to prison, but he was happy the judge listened to our argument, and the judge received the argument well. He was satisfied with the outcome,\u201d Shiesty\u2019s defence lawyer Bradford Cohen told Rolling Stone. \u201cWe\u2019re happy with the decision of the court.\u201d Pooh Shiesty (Picture: Paras Griffin/Getty Images) According to prosecutors, Williams allegedly drove a rented McLaren to the Landon Hotel on the day of the October 2020 shooting to \u201cpurchase a pair of high-end athletic sneakers and marijuana\u201d. Video surveillance allegedly showed Williams pulling up to the hotel with another man described as his road manager riding in the front and a third man following behind them in a black Mercedes Maybach. After he accepted a bag of marijuana and examined a pair of sneakers, Williams allegedly pulled out a Draco subcompact weapon and ended up firing, hitting the alleged victim in the buttocks, investigators previously claimed. As Williams drove off, a Louis Vuitton bag stuffed with $40,912 in cash fell out of the driver\u2019s seat of the McLaren, authorities claimed. Investigators said they linked the cash to the rapper by matching the full serial number on one of the recovered bills to a $100 bill shown on his Instagram account days before the alleged robbery. In June 2021, Pooh Shiesty was arrested in connection with a Memorial Day weekend shooting at a Miami strip club. The outcome of that case is not yet known. "

            "content": "Machine Gun Kelly (aka Colson Baker) has released the first trailer for Good Mourning, his directorial debut as a filmmaker.\u00a0 First announced last August, it was confirmed last week that Good Mourning \u2013 a stoner comedy that Baker co-wrote, directed and stars in alongside fellow musician\u00a0Mod Sun, fianc\u00e9e Megan Fox and close friend Pete Davidson \u2013 will arrive on May 20. It\u2019ll land simultaneously in cinemas and on demand, though it\u2019s not clear as of yet which platform will host the film\u2019s digital release. Baker stars in the film as London Clash, an actor in the midst of an existential crisis. So the logline goes, Clash\u2019s \u201cworld is turned upside down\u201d when, on the morning of a crucial meeting with the director of a Batman film, he \u201cwakes up to an implied breakup text from the love of his life\u201d.\u00a0 The synopsis for Good Mourning continues: \u201cCompounded by chaotic roommates and wildly unpredictable twists and turns, London\u2019s day keeps going downhill until ultimately, he is forced to choose between pursuing his one true love and landing a life-changing, starring role in a major motion picture.\u201d Watch the trailer for Good Mourning below:  In a statement shared with the announcement of the film\u2019s release date, Open Road Films CEO Tom Ortenberg said: \u201cWe are looking forward to bringing this wild comedy to audiences in theaters and at home on demand. The film is a reminder of how fun movies can be to make and watch Colson and this incredible cast will bring audiences to their knees in laughter and leave their jaws on the floor.\u201d The sentiment was shared by Cedar Park Studios\u2019 Added Long, who added: \u201cOur goal at Cedar Park Studios is to provide opportunities to fresh, creative voices in the industry and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to be working with first-time filmmakers Colson and Mod. Bold in their approach, they have assembled a troupe of top-tier talent to join them on this hilarious ride. We\u2019re ecstatic to be a part of their filmmaking debut.\u201d\u00a0 Good Mourning will mark Baker\u2019s third film for 2022, following his cameo in Jackass Forever and a starring role in the music drama Taurus. It\u2019ll also mark his third time linking up with Pete Davidson, having made cameos in Big Time Adolescence and The King Of Staten Island.\u00a0  As Machine Gun Kelly, the multi-hyphenate released his sixth album, \u2018Mainstream Sellout\u2019, last month. In a four-star review of it, NME\u2019s Ali Shutler said the album is \u201cdriven by a relatable sense of angst and its outsider anthems will continue to speak to the millions who see Machine Gun Kelly as the saviour of punk rock\u201d. Shutler continued: \u201cFor better or worse, Baker makes no attempts to convert those who still doubt him, though. \u2018Mainstream Sellout\u2019 finds its author still refusing to play by the old rules, though it inevitably lacks the shock of the new that made \u2018Tickets To My Downfall\u2019 so exciting. Still, it seems that, like the pop-punk revival itself, Machine Gun Kelly won\u2019t run out of steam any time soon.\u201d B.I has announced his plans to release a \u201cglobal album project\u201d for this year. Today (April 21), a cryptic announcement video was uploaded to the singer-rapper\u2019s YouTube channel, completely animated with a cyberpunk aesthetic that seems to signal the visual concept for the new project. At the end of the teaser, it is revealed that there are plans for a pre-release single and two EPs to be put out this year under the project, dubbed \u2018Love Or Loved (LOL)\u2019. More details are expected to arrive in the coming months.  It was first revealed in February this year that B.I has plans for singles, a global EP and tours this year, after the K-pop idol had signed a new deal with United Stated-based talent management agency Wasserman. He is also now managed by Billie Eilish\u2018s agent, Tom Windish, for promotions in North and South America, as well as Australia. B.I\u2019s last music release was\u00a0his six-track \u2018Cosmos\u2019 \u201chalf album\u201d that arrived in November 2021, featuring a lead single of the same name. It was also his first project since releasing\u00a0his debut solo album \u2018Waterfall\u2019 in June, which\u00a0included collaborations with K-pop vocalist\u00a0Lee Hi\u00a0(on \u2018Daydream\u2019) and rapper\u00a0Tablo\u00a0of\u00a0Epik High\u00a0(on \u2018Stay\u2019).  In other news, TXT and Atlanta rapper Rich The Kid have dropped several cryptic hints about a potential collaboration on the group\u2019s upcoming mini-album \u2018minisode 2: Thursday\u2019s Child\u2019 in a series of social media posts on Weverse and Twitter. However, neither party has confirmed the rumours as of writing. The record\u2019s tracklist will be revealed on May 1, before the album itself is released in full on May 9. "

            "content": "Big Thief frontwoman Adrianne Lenker has asked fans in a video message to stop talking through their support acts\u2019 sets. The Brooklyn band are currently out on a North American headline tour in support of their fifth studio album, \u2018Dragon New Warm Mountain I Believe in You\u2019,\u00a0which came out in February via 4AD. Canadian musician and producer Kara-Lis Coverdale is currently opening for Big Thief at the ongoing concerts, per Stereogum. Earlier this week, Lenker took to Instagram to share a video message in which she outlined her \u201cfeelings r.e talking during openers and attention/creating respectful show environment in general\u201d. \u201cHello, friends. Hello. This has been on my mind for a few days now. Actually, I should say this has been on my mind for a lot longer than that,\u201d she began. \u201cIt\u2019s really come forward in the last few days that: when music is happening in a room, there\u2019s a performer on stage playing and doing their craft, when you enter into that space, try to be mindful of what\u2019s happening and pay attention and don\u2019t talk. \u201cAnd if you want to talk and greet people and socialise, you can totally do that. But just when you do it in the room where a performance is going on, other people who are there to listen don\u2019t have any say at all in what\u2019s happening. And then suddenly the space is loud.\u201d  A post shared by adrianne lenker (@adriannelenker)  Lenker went on to say that a sense of \u201creal magic\u201d is created in venues when there is silence from the audience: \u201cSometimes I have this feeling like, \u2018If only the room were quiet, this could just be so incredible\u2019. \u201cLike, people are missing so much. Because every time there\u2019s meant to be a silence, there\u2019s all this sort of white noise chatter.\u201d The musician then requested that those attending live gigs \u201cbe mindful\u201d of other people when any sort of performance is taking place on stage. \u201cEither listen or at least be quiet so that other people can listen,\u201d she said. \u201cOr go and put yourself elsewhere.\u201d Lenker added: \u201cI just think that because it\u2019s a common space people should be able to enjoy the full breadth of what the artist has to offer. Speaking for myself, I feel that when there is quiet, it allows for so much more dynamics, and it makes me feel like I can breathe as somebody creating sound waves. \u201cSo if you can be as respectful as possible, and just mindful. Sometimes people walk in and aren\u2019t aware of where they are. Their priority is to greet their friends or family who you\u2019re seeing. But just look around and if there is somebody who\u2019s on stage they\u2019re probably, like, pouring their heart out, and it\u2019s hard to sort of just be talked over.\u201d She concluded: \u201cDo your best, and I appreciate you.\u201d You can watch the video in full above.  Big Thief are set to perform at a string of UK and European festivals this summer, including\u00a0Glastonbury,\u00a0Primavera Sound,\u00a0Best Kept Secret\u00a0and\u00a0Tempelhof Sounds. You can find the band\u2019s full live schedule\u00a0here. Earlier this month, the group performed their recent single \u2018Spud Infinity\u2019 on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. "

            "content": "The Kid LAROI has shared his first new music of 2022 \u2013 a single entitled \u2018Thousand Miles\u2019. The song, released today (April 22), is the official follow-up to last July\u2019s \u2018Stay\u2019 with Justin Bieber. That song went on to be the most successful of LAROI\u2019s career, hitting Number One in over 20 countries and achieving multiple Platinum certifications \u2013 including seven in his native Australia. \u2018Thousand Miles\u2019 was co-written by LAROI with Andrew Watman, Louis Bell and Billy Walsh. Bell also co-produced the song alongside longtime Post Malone collaborator Andrew Watt. Both he and Watman are working with LAROI for the first time on this song, while Walsh served as producer on LAROI\u2019s 2021 hit \u2018Without You\u2019. A music video for \u2018Thousand Miles\u2019 was also released. Directed by Christian Breslauer, it shows LAROI being violently tortured by an evil version of himself. Identified by his blood red outfits, the evil LAROI drags his innocent counterpart (clad in all-white) down a street, drops a grand piano on him, and drives into him with a steam train. Have a look at the video below:  Prior to the release of \u2018Thousand Miles\u2019, LAROI teased the single\u2019s release by using a snippet as audio for two separate TikToks, asking his followers to show him their \u201clast mistake\u201d. The first of these saw LAROI splice the footage with photos of his former manager Scooter Braun, who was relieved of his role last year only months after coming on board. The second then saw LAROI poke fun at himself, adding in an early photo of himself with a regrettable haircut. Earlier this week, a seven-second teaser for the song and its music video was posted to LAROI\u2019s YouTube channel. The clip saw LAROI licking an ice cream cone on a park bench, before suddenly looking up and having a piano fall on top of him.  A minute-long trailer for the music video was then shared, which gave context to the previous teaser. The video, directed by Christian Breslauer, seemingly depicts two separate LAROIs \u2013 with one, donning red attire, attempting to sabotage the other that is donning white attire. The video is set to premiere on LAROI\u2019s YouTube channel on Friday night Pacific Time (PT) in the United States. "

According to legal documents obtained by Complex, the Canadian rapper \u2013 real name Aubrey Drake Graham \u2013 filed the order through his lawyers last month after being harassed for a number of years. Larry Stein and Ashley Yeargan, who are representing Drake, later secured a temporary restraining order for their client. It is claimed in their filing that the alleged stalker had been arrested in 2017 for trespassing on Drake\u2019s estate in the Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles. The alleged perpetrator was subsequently identified as a 29-year-old woman called Mesha Collins. According to Drake\u2019s legal team, Collins had sent disturbing emails to Drake referring to him and his family. In one of the alleged messages, it was suggested that Drake should shoot himself and his son. \u201cPut a bullet through your head now bitch,\u201d it read (via Complex). Stein and Yeargan have also accused Collins of attempting to reach Drake by filing a $4billion (\u00a33.02billion) defamation lawsuit against the rapper, which was ultimately dismissed late last year. Los Angeles Superior Court judge Virginia Keeny declared that Collins had \u201cnot demonstrated any of defendant [Drake\u2019s] statements were about plaintiff Collins or that he used her identity, name, or likeness in his Instagram posts or endorsements\u201d. Drake performs live (Picture: Getty) Drake\u2019s attorneys previously called the complaint \u201cfrivolous\u201d and said that Collins had filed it based on \u201cdelusional figments of her imagination\u201d in a bid to make contact with their client. Stein said the claims that Drake defamed Collins were \u201cpure fiction\u201d, and assured that \u201cuntil he was served with this lawsuit, [Drake] had no idea who Collins was\u201d. According to TMZ, Collins is required to stay at least 100 yards away from Drake, his four-year-old son, his mother and his father under the restraining order, which is due to expire on April 11, 2025. It is reported that Collins did not attend this week\u2019s court hearing, but will receive \u201ctimely and proper notice\u201d of the verdict. In other news, speculation around potential new music from Drake was sparked last month after the \u2018Certified Lover Boy\u2019 artist was pictured in a recording studio. "

            "content": "According to Smashing Pumpkins\u2019 longstanding guitarist Jeff Schroeder, the band have finished working on their \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cepic\u201d 12th studio album. Word of the LP first came before the release of 2020\u2019s \u2018CYR\u2019, when frontman Billy Corgan said it would be a sequel to both their 1995 album \u2018Mellon Collie And The Infinite Sadness\u2019 and 2000\u2019s \u2018Machina\u2019 records. He described it at the time as \u201ckind of a rock opera\u201d, and confirmed last March that he and the rest of the Pumpkins had begun recording material for it. Work seemed to progress quickly, as Schroeder said last July that the band was \u201cabout halfway through\u201d the recording process. During an appearance on the Audio Ink Radio podcast, Schroeder reconfirmed that the Pumpkins\u2019 12th album would end the saga started with \u2018Mellon Collie\u2019 and continued with \u2018Machina\u2019, and that it would sport a sprawling 33-song tracklist. In another interview with Audio Ink Radio, released today (April 21), Schroeder told host Anne Erickson that the as-yet-untitled album was finally completed, though he conceded that there was \u201cnothing [he] can give details on quite yet\u201d. He did hint that it would be released this year, though, noting that the Pumpkins had \u201csome pretty exciting announcements [to make] at some point during [their upcoming North American tour]\u201d. Listen to Schroeder\u2019s full appearance on Audio Ink Radio below:  Smashing Pumpkins are due to begin their \u2018Rock Invasion 2\u2019 tour at the end of April, kicking off with an appearance at the Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis. Find dates, details and tickets for the tour here. In a three-star review of \u2018CYR\u2019, NME\u2019s Damian Jones wrote: \u201cFor the most part, the songs furrow a similar path throughout the 20 tracks and, unlike most double albums, which are either loaded with fillers or come in two bloated parts, \u2018CYR\u2019 feels like a single complete record crammed full of pop anthems.\u00a0  \u201cPumpkin detractors may well hate this record\u2019s simplicity, and they\u2019d be right to criticise it for sounding same-y to a point. But there\u2019s no denying Corgan\u2019s ability to craft a tune, or the fact that the return of original members James Iha and Jimmy Chamberlin has clearly brought back some of that Pumpkins chemistry of old.\u201d "

It is alleged that Rocky had been under investigation by the Los Angeles Police Department over a shooting near Vista Del Mar and Selma Ave at around 10:20pm local time on November 6 last year.

He was later released that August before being found guilty of assault\u00a0and handed a suspended sentence\u00a0and ordered to pay damages. A strange turn of events in the case came when US President Donald Trump appeared to get involved, along with his son-in-law Jared Kushner and a hostage negotiator from the State Department.

But, as reported in the Daily Star\u2018s WIRED column, he also revealed that he has some \u201cmore chilled\u201d songs leftover which he thinks could go towards an entire album of love songs. He told the publication: \u201cDuring the pandemic everyone was having a moment about how beautiful the world is and what we\u2019ve done to it and, \u2018Is this the end?\u2019. Everyone was going through these mad things and I thought if we do get a chance to do a record maybe everyone will be coming back with these rocking records and saying how much they hate the Government and all this nonsense. \u201cAnd so I thought that maybe we would come at it from a different angle, maybe we\u2019ll do an album full of love songs, something a bit more chilled like Simon and Garfunkel kind of thing.\u201d He continued: \u201cThere were a couple of songs like that on the go but then it went back to the mad stuff, the rock\u2019n\u2019roll stuff. Then it went back to the love, kind of chilled stuff and then we ended up with \u2018C\u2019mon You Know\u2019. I reckon there\u2019s half a record left which is a more chilled record.\u201d  Gallagher echoed this sentiment in a recent interview with NME about the new album. \u201cI just thought, \u2018Fuck that shit \u2013 I don\u2019t want to fucking hear about [the pandemic] ever again\u2019, do you know what I mean? \u2018Maybe we\u2019ll come out and make a love album \u2013 really lovely; not a rock\u2019n\u2019roll record.\u2019\u201d Though he had a change of heart around the record, he noted that he would like to one day go back to that idea and complete a \u201ctrippier\u201d album, adding: \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of time for that.\u201d Earlier this week, Gallagher\u00a0announced his latest collaboration with Adidas and confirmed details of an intimate live show in Blackburn next week.

It\u2019ll land simultaneously in cinemas and on demand, though it\u2019s not clear as of yet which platform will host the film\u2019s digital release. Baker stars in the film as London Clash, an actor in the midst of an existential crisis. So the logline goes, Clash\u2019s \u201cworld is turned upside down\u201d when, on the morning of a crucial meeting with the director of a Batman film, he \u201cwakes up to an implied breakup text from the love of his life\u201d.\u00a0 The synopsis for Good Mourning continues: \u201cCompounded by chaotic roommates and wildly unpredictable twists and turns, London\u2019s day keeps going downhill until ultimately, he is forced to choose between pursuing his one true love and landing a life-changing, starring role in a major motion picture.\u201d Watch the trailer for Good Mourning below:  In a statement shared with the announcement of the film\u2019s release date, Open Road Films CEO Tom Ortenberg said: \u201cWe are looking forward to bringing this wild comedy to audiences in theaters and at home on demand. The film is a reminder of how fun movies can be to make and watch Colson and this incredible cast will bring audiences to their knees in laughter and leave their jaws on the floor.\u201d The sentiment was shared by Cedar Park Studios\u2019 Added Long, who added: \u201cOur goal at Cedar Park Studios is to provide opportunities to fresh, creative voices in the industry and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to be working with first-time filmmakers Colson and Mod. Bold in their approach, they have assembled a troupe of top-tier talent to join them on this hilarious ride. We\u2019re ecstatic to be a part of their filmmaking debut.\u201d\u00a0 Good Mourning will mark Baker\u2019s third film for 2022, following his cameo in Jackass Forever and a starring role in the music drama Taurus. It\u2019ll also mark his third time linking up with Pete Davidson, having made cameos in Big Time Adolescence and The King Of Staten Island.\u00a0  As Machine Gun Kelly, the multi-hyphenate released his sixth album, \u2018Mainstream Sellout\u2019, last month. In a four-star review of it, NME\u2019s Ali Shutler said the album is \u201cdriven by a relatable sense of angst and its outsider anthems will continue to speak to the millions who see Machine Gun Kelly as the saviour of punk rock\u201d. Shutler continued: \u201cFor better or worse, Baker makes no attempts to convert those who still doubt him, though. \u2018Mainstream Sellout\u2019 finds its author still refusing to play by the old rules, though it inevitably lacks the shock of the new that made \u2018Tickets To My Downfall\u2019 so exciting. Still, it seems that, like the pop-punk revival itself, Machine Gun Kelly won\u2019t run out of steam any time soon.\u201d B.I has announced his plans to release a \u201cglobal album project\u201d for this year. Today (April 21), a cryptic announcement video was uploaded to the singer-rapper\u2019s YouTube channel, completely animated with a cyberpunk aesthetic that seems to signal the visual concept for the new project. At the end of the teaser, it is revealed that there are plans for a pre-release single and two EPs to be put out this year under the project, dubbed \u2018Love Or Loved (LOL)\u2019. More details are expected to arrive in the coming months.  It was first revealed in February this year that B.I has plans for singles, a global EP and tours this year, after the K-pop idol had signed a new deal with United Stated-based talent management agency Wasserman. He is also now managed by Billie Eilish\u2018s agent, Tom Windish, for promotions in North and South America, as well as Australia. B.I\u2019s last music release was\u00a0his six-track \u2018Cosmos\u2019 \u201chalf album\u201d that arrived in November 2021, featuring a lead single of the same name. It was also his first project since releasing\u00a0his debut solo album \u2018Waterfall\u2019 in June, which\u00a0included collaborations with K-pop vocalist\u00a0Lee Hi\u00a0(on \u2018Daydream\u2019) and rapper\u00a0Tablo\u00a0of\u00a0Epik High\u00a0(on \u2018Stay\u2019).

The track is the singer\u2019s first single of 2022, following last year\u2019s \u2018Don\u2019t Wait Up\u2019, which was also her first completely English single since 2016\u2019s \u2018Try Everything\u2019. The accompanying music video for \u2018Te Felicito\u2019, directed by Jaume de la Iguana and filmed in Barcelona, features Shakira playfully dancing in a futuristic environment with a robot. She then constructs a robot boyfriend (Alejandro), who joins in as the pair take on some robot-inspired choreography.  Shakira\u2019s last album \u2018El Dorado\u2019 was released in 2017, and included the singles \u2018Chantaje\u2019, \u2018Me Enamor\u00e9\u2019, \u2018Perro Fiel\u2019 and \u2018Trap\u2019, the latter of which featured guest vocals from Maluma. In 2020, Shakira teamed up with Jennifer Lopez to perform at the Super Bowl halftime show. The highly praised performance at Miami\u2019s Hard Rock Stadium saw them rattle through 20 songs in 12 minutes. \u201cHola Miami!\u201d Shakira told the crowd as she opened with \u2018She Wolf\u2019. She then segued into \u2018Empire\u2019 \u2013 which saw her unexpectedly covering Led Zeppelin\u2019s \u2018Kashmir\u2019 on a black sequinned guitar. A duet with Latin star Bad Bunny saw the pair covering Cardi B\u2019s \u2018I Like It\u2019, before she eventually closed her set with \u2018Hips Don\u2019t Lie\u2019. She appeared again for the finale, which was a joint performance with Lopez of \u2018Waka Waka\u2019.  Meanwhile, last year, Shakira was involved in a\u00a0bizarre incident where wild boars snatched her handbag while she was relaxing in a Barcelona park. \u201cIt\u2019s just crazy!\u201d she reflected to\u00a0Glamour of the incident as well as the social media reaction to her story. \u201cI was taking my son, Milan, for a walk in the park and I got him a little ice cream,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe sat on one of those park benches and we were just minding our own business. And then two huge wild boars came from the back and ambushed [us] and took my purse! And I was like, \u2018Oh, my God! Oh, my God!\u2019 and screaming, because they were taking it away, with my phone in it, my car keys, everything! Like they could understand me! And people were just watching and they weren\u2019t doing anything!\u201d "

            "content": "Travis Scott has appeared on a widely-available single for the first time since last year\u2019s Astroworld festival, where a tragic crowd crush led to the death of 10 people and many more injuries. \u2018Hold That Heat\u2019 is a collaboration between 808 Mafia producer Southside, rapper Future and Scott, and arrives alongside a Philip Andelman-directed video that features Scott holding an alligator on a chain. It marks Scott\u2019s second appearance since the events of Astroworld back in November. The rapper featured on Kanye West\u2018s \u2018Donda 2\u2019 track \u2018Pablo\u2019, also alongside Future. As with the rest of \u2018Donda 2\u2019, the song is only officially available for listening through West\u2019s Donda Stem Player device. Watch the video for \u2018Hold That Heat\u2019 below:  10 people were killed \u2013 with hundreds more injured \u2013 as a result of a crowd surge that took place during Scott\u2019s headline set at Astroworld in Houston on November 5, 2021. The following month, the cause of death for all 10 victims was ruled as accidental compressive asphyxiation. In December, Scott gave his first interview since the Astroworld tragedy, telling Charlamage Tha God he had a \u201cresponsibility to figure out what happened\u201d during the incident. Scott\u2019s response was criticised by family members of some of the victims of the tragedy, saying the rapper should have been more proactive about stopping the set. Last month, he announced the launch of his multi-million dollar Project HEAL initiative, and said he would \u201calways honor the victims of the Astroworld tragedy\u201d. The rapper was accused of violating a gag order by announcing the initiative. Scott is currently facing hundreds of combined lawsuits over the events that unfolded at Astroworld. The rapper has slowly been reappearing in public life since the tragedy took place. He reportedly performed a short set at a private pre-Oscars party late last month in Bel Air, and a brief DJ set at a Coachella afterparty over the weekend.  A day prior to Astroworld, Scott released two singles, \u2018Escape Plan\u2019 and \u2018Mafia\u2019. It\u2019s unclear if either song will feature on the rapper\u2019s forthcoming album \u2018Utopia\u2019, details of which have not been revealed. Earlier this month, billboards teasing the album appeared in California, reading: \u201cPSST\u2026\u2026. Looking for UTOPIA? WRONG WAY!\u201d along with the logo of Scott\u2019s Cactus Jack label. "

In other BTS news, the seven-piece announced details of a new album set for release in June earlier this week. The forthcoming record was first teased at the last of the band\u2019s recent four-night Las Vegas residency, when a date of \u20182022.06.10\u2019 \u2013 June 10 \u2013 came up on screen at the end of the show, alongside the tagline: \u201cWe are bulletproof.\u201d "

            "content": "Machine Gun Kelly (aka Colson Baker) has released the first trailer for Good Mourning, his directorial debut as a filmmaker.\u00a0 First announced last August, it was confirmed last week that Good Mourning \u2013 a stoner comedy that Baker co-wrote, directed and stars in alongside fellow musician\u00a0Mod Sun, fianc\u00e9e Megan Fox and close friend Pete Davidson \u2013 will arrive on May 20. It\u2019ll land simultaneously in cinemas and on demand, though it\u2019s not clear as of yet which platform will host the film\u2019s digital release. Baker stars in the film as London Clash, an actor in the midst of an existential crisis. So the logline goes, Clash\u2019s \u201cworld is turned upside down\u201d when, on the morning of a crucial meeting with the director of a Batman film, he \u201cwakes up to an implied breakup text from the love of his life\u201d.\u00a0 The synopsis for Good Mourning continues: \u201cCompounded by chaotic roommates and wildly unpredictable twists and turns, London\u2019s day keeps going downhill until ultimately, he is forced to choose between pursuing his one true love and landing a life-changing, starring role in a major motion picture.\u201d Watch the trailer for Good Mourning below:  In a statement shared with the announcement of the film\u2019s release date, Open Road Films CEO Tom Ortenberg said: \u201cWe are looking forward to bringing this wild comedy to audiences in theaters and at home on demand. The film is a reminder of how fun movies can be to make and watch Colson and this incredible cast will bring audiences to their knees in laughter and leave their jaws on the floor.\u201d The sentiment was shared by Cedar Park Studios\u2019 Added Long, who added: \u201cOur goal at Cedar Park Studios is to provide opportunities to fresh, creative voices in the industry and we couldn\u2019t be more excited to be working with first-time filmmakers Colson and Mod. Bold in their approach, they have assembled a troupe of top-tier talent to join them on this hilarious ride. We\u2019re ecstatic to be a part of their filmmaking debut.\u201d\u00a0 Good Mourning will mark Baker\u2019s third film for 2022, following his cameo in Jackass Forever and a starring role in the music drama Taurus. It\u2019ll also mark his third time linking up with Pete Davidson, having made cameos in Big Time Adolescence and The King Of Staten Island.\u00a0  As Machine Gun Kelly, the multi-hyphenate released his sixth album, \u2018Mainstream Sellout\u2019, last month. In a four-star review of it, NME\u2019s Ali Shutler said the album is \u201cdriven by a relatable sense of angst and its outsider anthems will continue to speak to the millions who see Machine Gun Kelly as the saviour of punk rock\u201d. Shutler continued: \u201cFor better or worse, Baker makes no attempts to convert those who still doubt him, though. \u2018Mainstream Sellout\u2019 finds its author still refusing to play by the old rules, though it inevitably lacks the shock of the new that made \u2018Tickets To My Downfall\u2019 so exciting. Still, it seems that, like the pop-punk revival itself, Machine Gun Kelly won\u2019t run out of steam any time soon.\u201d "

            "content": "Sigrid and Bring Me The Horizon have released a new collaboration together \u2013 listen to \u00a0\u2018Bad Life\u2019 below. Sigrid had teased the collaboration on TikTok last week (April 14), sharing\u00a0a behind the scenes montage between BMTH frontman Oli Sykes and herself. The video was set to an audio clip of the forthcoming single, with the lyrics \u201cIt\u2019s just a bad day/ Not a bad life\u201d sung by the pair.\u00a0It\u2019s the first time the hardcore outfit have collaborated with the Norwegian singer-songwriter. Speaking about the track, Sigrid said:\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m so excited about \u2018Bad Life\u2019 being out in the world with the Bring Me boys! We\u2019re really proud of this one, and we hope it can bring some comfort. \u201cIt might not be the most likely collab, but we\u2019ve been fans of each other for a while and we\u2019re so happy we could collaborate on this song. And filming the video was an amazing and crazy experience in itself!\u201d Sigrid added of the track: \u201cIt tells the story of when things are rough and it can feel like you\u2019re never going to stop feeling sad.\u201d Sykes added: \u201cJordan and myself wrote this song in lockdown, remotely. We loved the message but it wasn\u2019t really fitting with the brief of the record we are currently creating.\u201cWhen we found out Sigrid was a fan we felt like it was the perfect fit for her, although initially I was reluctant as I felt like it was such a special record. Then Sigrid asked if I\u2019d duet with her on the track and that sealed the deal!\u201dA statement about the collaboration explained more about how the collaboration came about. \u201cAfter a chance meeting with UK rock band Bring Me The Horizon backstage [At Reading & Leeds Fesitval], they realised they were both fans of each other\u2019s music,\u201d the statement read. \u201cThis led to vocalist Oli Sykes and keyboardist Jordan Fish sending a demo, they all got in the studio to lay down lyrics, and the tear-stained rock ballad \u2018Bad Life\u2019 was born.\u201dSpeaking about the video to accompany the track, director Raja Verdi added: \u201cThe concept for this one shot film was to lean into the themes of having to get through the bad to eventually reach the other side \u2013 life can certainly feel like a rollercoaster sometimes.\u201dThe song marks the latest in a strong of collaborations released by BMTH. Earlier this month, the band featured on the Masked Wolf single \u2018Fallout\u2019, while March marked another team up with Machine Gun Kelly with the release of \u2018maybe\u2019. In other Sigrid news, the singer\u00a0announced in March the forthcoming release of a new album, \u2018How To Let Go\u2019. Set to drop on May 6, the second studio effort serves as the follow-up to 2019\u2019s \u2018Sucker Punch\u2019. From it, the artist has shared the singles \u2018It Gets Dark\u2019, \u2018Burning Bridges\u2019 and \u2018Mirror\u2019. "

The video has been directed by Paterson director\u00a0Jim Jarmusch and it\u2019s the first time the pair have collaborated on a work together. Speaking about the project, Jarmusch said:\u00a0\u201cAs someone who deeply loves Cat Power\u2019s music, getting to collaborate with [Cat Power] on this video was like a dream come true,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s so inspiring to me, of course as an artist, but she\u2019s also just such an extraordinary person.\u201d Watch the video here:  The track is taken from Power\u2019s latest album, \u2018Covers\u2019, which sees the musician interpreting other people\u2019s songs. In a review of the album, NME said:\u00a0\u201cThere\u2019s nothing in the world like a Cat Power cover version. The artist also known as Chan Marshall made herself known as one of the 21st century\u2019s finest interpreters of other artists\u2019 material \u2013 her re-imaginings as emotionally devastating as they are decidedly dreamlike \u2013 at the very beginning of the millennium. \u201c\u2026Often, cover records are dismissed as simply a bit of fun or as an indulgent aside to an artists\u2019 original output, but when Cat Power does it, it\u2019s nothing less than soul-nourishing.\u201d  Meanwhile,\u00a0Cat Power is among the new support acts that have been announced for Pearl Jam\u2018s pair of Hyde Park shows this summer. Pearl Jam will play at the BST Hyde Park series in central London on July 8 and 9, with Pixies already set to support the band on the opening night. BST Hyde Park announced a host of support acts for both shows. Cat Power, White Reaper, The Murder Capital, The Glorious Sons, Simon Townshend, La Luz, Sick Joy and Dream Nails will all play on July 8 prior to Pearl Jam\u2019s headline slot. While\u00a0Stereophonics lead the support acts on July 9, with Imelda May, The Last Internationale, La Luz, JJ Wilde and The Wild Things also set to perform. "

Willow\u2019s verse adds a wealth of colour to the soundscape, her sharper and more sober tone gelling with PinkPantheress\u2019 more angelic vocal melody. The song also samples \u2018Never Let This Go\u2019 by Paramore, appearing on their 2005 debut album, \u2018All We Know Is Falling\u2019. Paramore are credited as co-writers of \u2018Where You Are\u2019, while Skrillex and Mura Masa are listed as producers (alongside PinkPantheress herself).

The track was then formally announced last Monday (April 11). Earlier this year, PinkPantheress was named as the winner of BBC Radio 1\u2019s Sound Of 2022. \u201cI\u2019m honestly gassed, my dad\u2019s going to be so happy!\u201d she told the\u00a0BBC about the win. \u201cI had self-belief from the beginning but when other people start telling you stuff like this, it genuinely keeps you going.\u201d She also said that her fans should \u201cexpect a feature or two\u201d in terms of new music in 2022. \u201cI\u2019ve been a bit of a lone wolf so far, but I\u2019ve been really been trying to get into my collaboration bag. That\u2019s the thing I\u2019m most excited for.\u201d PinkPantheress will perform at Manchester\u2019s Parklife festival in June.

            "content": "Johnny Depp has opened up about his drug use during his defamation suit against ex-wife Amber Heard, mentioning his interactions with Marilyn Manson. The actor has been permitted by a Virginia judge to pursue his case against his ex-wife, suing her for defamation over a 2018 Washington Post\u00a0op-ed in which she wrote about surviving domestic violence. Heard did not mention Depp by name in the article, but Depp\u2019s lawyers have argued that it falsely implies she was sexually and physically abused by Depp during their marriage. Heard has also filed a counterclaim against Depp, arguing he has created a smear campaign against her. During his cross-examination in the ongoing trial this week, Depp was asked by Heard\u2019s lawyer about his drug use with Manson, with the intention of further delving into the actor\u2019s history with substance abuse. \u201cWe drank together, we\u2019ve had cocaine together maybe a couple of times,\u201d Depp said. Heard\u2019s lawyer then asked if pills were involved, and Depp replied with a chuckle: \u201cI once gave Marilyn Manson a pill so that he would stop talking so much.\u201d  Later, the lawyer showed the court a photo of a Keith Richards demo CD next to four apparent lines of cocaine and glasses of beer. There was also a box in the photo with Depp\u2019s initials and a skull and crossbones. When Heard\u2019s lawyer asked if the box contained cocaine, Depp said: \u201cI can\u2019t say that I carried cocaine in it \u2026 but it looks like it would fit some cocaine.\u201d The trial continues, with James Franco and Elon Musk among the names set to testify. According to Deadline, Franco and Musk are being brought in to testify on behalf of Heard after Depp accused them both of having an affair with his ex-wife. Amber Heard and Johnny Depp (Picture: Getty Images) In 2020 Depp lost a libel lawsuit against\u00a0The Sun, which concerned the newspaper publishing an article in April 2018 referring to him as a \u201cwife beater\u201d. Judge Mr Justice Nicol said in a ruling that he found the words to be \u201csubstantially true\u201d. Depp said last year that\u00a0he believes he is being boycotted by Hollywood, suggesting that the industry is taking note of his \u201cunpleasant and messy situation\u201d. "

In a video obtained by TMZ, Songz is seen approaching a woman and then pulling down her bikini top, exposing her breast. The woman, Megan Johnson, is demanding the settlement payment to keep the matter out of court. According to the demand letter, Johnson was having a friend take a picture of her when Songz approached her from the side, pulling down her top. \u201cMs. Johnson immediately pulled her top back on preparing herself for another assault,\u201d the letter states. \u201cWith intended premeditation, [Neverson] further terrorised and humiliated Ms. Johnson with [the] degrading chant, \u2018Titties in the Open\u2019.\u201d Johnson\u2019s legal team claimed that since the incident, which took place in 2013, she has \u201cengaged in self-harm, [and] suffered severe emotional distress\u201d. Songz has faced several accusations of sexual assault throughout his career and in recent months. In 2018, he was charged over a domestic violence case \u2013 during which he claimed via Twitter that he was being \u201cfalsely accused for someone\u2019s personal gain\u201d. Songz also\u00a0publicly responded to two separate allegations\u00a0via Twitter in mid-2020, and faced a further two accusations in early 2022 \u2013 one\u00a0a historical claim\u00a0from basketball player Dylan Gonzalez, the other as\u00a0part of a $20million lawsuit. Earlier this month, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) dropped an investigation into a sexual assault case pertaining to Songz, five months after it was filed. TMZ\u00a0reported that a LVMPD representative had given a statement on the case, which was originally filed in November 2021\u00a0following an incident at Las Vegas hotel and resort The Cosmopolitan. The statement noted that the department\u2019s investigation had \u201cconcluded\u201d, and that they had \u201cdetermined that no criminal charges will be filed\u201d. \u201cIf any new evidence comes to light, the case will be reopened for further investigation,\u201d the statement concluded. A further statement was also issued to\u00a0TMZ\u00a0from Songz\u2019 attorneys, David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld. The pair noted that they were \u201cpleased that Trey Songz has been cleared of wrongdoing\u201d. Rush\u2019s Geddy Lee has revealed that bandmate Neil Peart wanted to keep his cancer diagnosis a secret prior to his death. The visionary Hall of Fame drummer died on January 7, 2020, after quietly battling brain cancer for three years. Speaking in a new interview, Lee and Rush guitarist\u00a0Alex Lifeson discussed\u00a0Peart\u2019s final years and how he wanted to keep his illness quiet, which forced the band to protect his privacy by keeping fans in the dark. \u201c[Peart] didn\u2019t want anyone to know [about his illness],\u201d Lee said on\u00a0Canadian talk show\u00a0House Of Strombo. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t. He wanted to keep it in the house. And we did. And that was hard. I can\u2019t tell you it was easy, \u2019cause it was not easy. \u201cAnd it was ongoing. His diagnosis was\u2026 he was given 18 months at the most, and it went on three and a half years. And so that was a constant flow of us going to see him, giving him support.\u201d Lee then explained that the band had to be \u201cdishonest\u201d to fans in order to protect Peart\u2019s privacy. \u201cWhat his family had to live through was really difficult, so it was a lot of back-and-forth,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd when you\u2019re in that state, it\u2019s very hard to function normally, because you can\u2019t talk to anybody about it, \u2019cause no one\u2019s supposed to know. And so people hear rumblings and they bring things up to you, and you deflect it. And so that feels, on one hand, it feels dishonest, but on the other hand you\u2019re being loyal to your friend. So fuck the dishonesty part. That wins.\u201d He continued: \u201cI would say that was the most difficult time for us to move forward, during that whole thing, because we were in this bubble of grief sort of walking towards an inevitable and terrible conclusion.\u201d  Elsewhere in the interview, the two remaining members expressed disappointment in how\u00a0things essentially ended for Rush, prior to finding out about Peart\u2019s cancer diagnosis. \u201cLet\u2019s be honest, it was frustrating to end when we ended,\u201d said Lee. \u201cI was frustrated, because I worked so hard on that [40th anniversary] tour in terms of design and putting it all together and the whole concept of going backwards, a chronology that exposes itself or exploits itself while going back in time. And so I was really proud of it. I wanted to take it to Europe to play for the European fans, I wanted to take it to South America, and that wasn\u2019t gonna happen.\u201d Lifeson added: \u201cI thought we were all playing really, really well, and I probably could have continued to do another 30 shows, and I think Geddy felt the same way. But it was becoming really difficult for Neil to play at that level, and unless he could play a hundred percent at that level, he really didn\u2019t wanna do any more shows \u2026 And it was hard for him \u2013 a three-hour show playing the way he played. It\u2019s a miracle that he was even able to play.\u201d Meanwhile, Rush\u2019s\u00a0Geddy Lee has opened up on the affect of Taylor Hawkins\u2018 death on him, saying the Foo Fighters drummer\u2019s passing \u201cbroke my heart\u201d.

            "title": "Trey Songz facing $5million settlement demand for allegedly exposing woman\u2019s breast",
            "content": "Trey Songz has been hit with a $5million (\u00a33.87million) settlement demand after a fourth woman came forward to accuse him of sexual assault. In a video obtained by TMZ, Songz is seen approaching a woman and then pulling down her bikini top, exposing her breast. The woman, Megan Johnson, is demanding the settlement payment to keep the matter out of court. According to the demand letter, Johnson was having a friend take a picture of her when Songz approached her from the side, pulling down her top. \u201cMs. Johnson immediately pulled her top back on preparing herself for another assault,\u201d the letter states. \u201cWith intended premeditation, [Neverson] further terrorised and humiliated Ms. Johnson with [the] degrading chant, \u2018Titties in the Open\u2019.\u201d Johnson\u2019s legal team claimed that since the incident, which took place in 2013, she has \u201cengaged in self-harm, [and] suffered severe emotional distress\u201d. Songz has faced several accusations of sexual assault throughout his career and in recent months. In 2018, he was charged over a domestic violence case \u2013 during which he claimed via Twitter that he was being \u201cfalsely accused for someone\u2019s personal gain\u201d. Songz also\u00a0publicly responded to two separate allegations\u00a0via Twitter in mid-2020, and faced a further two accusations in early 2022 \u2013 one\u00a0a historical claim\u00a0from basketball player Dylan Gonzalez, the other as\u00a0part of a $20million lawsuit. Earlier this month, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) dropped an investigation into a sexual assault case pertaining to Songz, five months after it was filed. TMZ\u00a0reported that a LVMPD representative had given a statement on the case, which was originally filed in November 2021\u00a0following an incident at Las Vegas hotel and resort The Cosmopolitan. The statement noted that the department\u2019s investigation had \u201cconcluded\u201d, and that they had \u201cdetermined that no criminal charges will be filed\u201d. \u201cIf any new evidence comes to light, the case will be reopened for further investigation,\u201d the statement concluded. A further statement was also issued to\u00a0TMZ\u00a0from Songz\u2019 attorneys, David Chesnoff and Richard Schonfeld. The pair noted that they were \u201cpleased that Trey Songz has been cleared of wrongdoing\u201d. "

We lose our innocence as we age, and although fatalism and cynicism can creep in, we also begin to shift our focus toward gratitude for existence and for those that we love.\u201d The song comes alongside a dizzying video, directed by Searle and produced by Jamie Whymark, which sees the band set up in the centre of a rotating camera rig which captures every angle of their explosive performance.

During her set at Coachella, Meg introduced the track as \u201cvery motherfucking personal\u201d to her and said it was addressed \u201cto whom the fuck it may concern\u201d. Prior to the performance, she tweeted that \u201cevery time I play it for a woman they start jumping and clapping\u201d. \u201cLadies, love yourself, \u2019cause this shit could get ugly,\u201d she raps over a \u201990s hip-hop beat that samples Jodeci, Raekwon and Ghostface Killah\u2018s \u2018Freek\u2019n You (Remix)\u2019. Listen below:  In March, Megan dropped a collaboration with Dua Lipa titled \u2018Sweetest Pie\u2019. Both singles are set to feature on the Houston rapper\u2019s forthcoming second studio album, though details on that are yet to be revealed. Last month also saw Meg speak out about the \u201ccrazy double standards\u201d that women in rap face. \u201cI feel like we get critiqued so heavy because everybody just knows that women are the shit,\u201d the rapper said in an appearance on Lipa\u2019s podcast, At Your Service. \u201cSo they are looking for us to be the shit all the time.\u201d Elsewhere in the conversation, Lipa touched on the controversy surrounding Megan and Cardi B\u2018s 2020 hit single \u2018WAP\u2019. \u201cA boy could start rapping about popping pills and enjoying four women at one time, and nobody would have a problem with that. But if Megan Thee Stallion says, \u2018Eat my pussy\u2019 one time, there\u2019s uproar,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you get offended by a woman talking about how she likes to be pleased, then I think you need to take a step back and re-evaluate what you\u2019re into.\u201d \u2018Good News\u2019, Meg\u2019s debut studio album, arrived back in November of 2020. In a four-star review,\u00a0NME said the album found the rapper \u201cdetermined to retain her freewheeling positivity in a difficult year\u201d.  Last October, Meg released \u2018Something For Thee Hotties\u2019, a compilation record that features freestyles and previously-unreleased songs along with \u2018Thot Shit\u2019, which was released as a standalone single earlier that year.

            "content": "The Kid LAROI has shared his first new music of 2022 \u2013 a single entitled \u2018Thousand Miles\u2019. The song, released today (April 22), is the official follow-up to last July\u2019s \u2018Stay\u2019 with Justin Bieber. That song went on to be the most successful of LAROI\u2019s career, hitting Number One in over 20 countries and achieving multiple Platinum certifications \u2013 including seven in his native Australia. \u2018Thousand Miles\u2019 was co-written by LAROI with Andrew Watman, Louis Bell and Billy Walsh. Bell also co-produced the song alongside longtime Post Malone collaborator Andrew Watt. Both he and Watman are working with LAROI for the first time on this song, while Walsh served as producer on LAROI\u2019s 2021 hit \u2018Without You\u2019. A music video for \u2018Thousand Miles\u2019 was also released. Directed by Christian Breslauer, it shows LAROI being violently tortured by an evil version of himself. Identified by his blood red outfits, the evil LAROI drags his innocent counterpart (clad in all-white) down a street, drops a grand piano on him, and drives into him with a steam train. Have a look at the video below:  Prior to the release of \u2018Thousand Miles\u2019, LAROI teased the single\u2019s release by using a snippet as audio for two separate TikToks, asking his followers to show him their \u201clast mistake\u201d. The first of these saw LAROI splice the footage with photos of his former manager Scooter Braun, who was relieved of his role last year only months after coming on board. The second then saw LAROI poke fun at himself, adding in an early photo of himself with a regrettable haircut. Earlier this week, a seven-second teaser for the song and its music video was posted to LAROI\u2019s YouTube channel. The clip saw LAROI licking an ice cream cone on a park bench, before suddenly looking up and having a piano fall on top of him.  A minute-long trailer for the music video was then shared, which gave context to the previous teaser. The video, directed by Christian Breslauer, seemingly depicts two separate LAROIs \u2013 with one, donning red attire, attempting to sabotage the other that is donning white attire. The video is set to premiere on LAROI\u2019s YouTube channel on Friday night Pacific Time (PT) in the United States. Psy has dropped a teaser for the music video of an upcoming track titled \u2018Celeb\u2019, starring former Miss A member Bae Suzy. The South Korean unveiled the eccentric visual at midnight KST today (April 21), where both Bae and Psy are seen performing snippets of the song\u2019s choreography in the middle of a Psy-themed amusement park. \u201cYou so popular / Be my formula / May I call you a celeb?\u201d Psy sings in English in the 20-second teaser. \u2018Celeb\u2019 is a cut from Psy\u2019s upcoming ninth full-length album \u2018Psy 9th\u2019, which will be his first release after a five-year absence from music. \u2018Celeb\u2019, along with the album, is due out on April 29 at 6pm KST.  \u00a0 Notably, \u2018Celeb\u2019 and its music video first premiered in-person nearly three years ago during Psy\u2019s \u2018Summer Swag 2019\u2019 concert, where it was revealed that Psy and rapper Zico co-wrote and -composed the song. However, \u2018Celeb\u201ds inclusion in \u2018Psy 9th\u2019 will be the first time the song will be released officially. \u2018Celeb\u2019 is the latest track from the forthcoming record to have been revealed so far, following \u2018Happier\u2019 featuring K-R&B singer Crush, and a remake of Jermaine Jackson and Pia Zadora\u2019s 1984 hit single \u2018When The Rain Begins To Fall\u2019 with MAMAMOO\u00a0member\u00a0Hwasa. Psy is also set to work with Epik High\u2018s\u00a0Tablo,\u00a0Heize, Sung Si-kyung and more.

During an interview with KROQ at last weekend\u2019s Coachella, the musician was asked whether this was the case. \u201cWho knows, actually,\u201d Bridgers replied. \u201cI try to do things that are exciting so I never really know what I\u2019m gonna do.\u201d The singer went on to joke that she would be \u201cdropping a mixtape tomorrow\u201d.

And I was like, \u2018This is insane\u2019.\u201d  She continued: \u201cI was so obsessed with it, I was playing it all the time in the house. And when the show asked me to make something, I was like, \u2018But I don\u2019t have anything that fits\u2019. And Marshall was like, \u2018What about that \u2018Sidelines\u2019 one?'\u201d Bridgers said that the pair then re-wrote some of the song and \u201cchanged some stuff around\u201d before re-recording it for Conversations With Friends. \u201cAnd it just kind of magically fit and was exactly what I wanted,\u201d she added. Bridgers, who\u2019s a longtime fan of Sally Rooney, wrote \u2018Sidelines\u2019 from the perspective of someone fearless before the introduction of love gives the character \u201csomething to lose\u201d.

The clip opens with a woman (played by IU) humming to herself as she tends to a crying baby, before cutting to a man in the driver\u2019s seat of a car, glancing at a baby in a casket in the seat next to him. We see him transporting the baby to an undisclosed location with the help of a team, saying: \u201cIn a way, I guess you could say it\u2019s an act of good faith?\u201d It\u2019s then revealed that the man has plans to sell the baby, and is part of an illegal operation that does so, with two detectives hot on their heels.  Broker\u00a0marks acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Kore-eda\u2019s first-ever Korean-language film, which will premiere in competition at the 2022 Cannes Film Festival next month.

Self-described as a \u201cbroker\u201d of goodwill, Sang-hyun works with Dong-soo (Gang) in this line of work, during which they cross paths with So-young (IU), who leaves her own baby in the baby box. Bae and Lee portray the lead detectives in the cast against the broker, who are determined to uncover the operation.  The film was first announced in August 2020, during which it was revealed that Kore-eda, who both wrote and directed the project, had conceived the original screenplay roughly seven years ago as of 2022.

In it, Welch plays herself, while Nighy takes on the role of Florence\u2019s anxiety. See the pair interacting in the \u2018Free\u2019 video below.  Earlier this week, Welch and co. previewed new \u2018Dance Fever\u2019 tracks \u2013 including \u2018Free\u2019 \u2013 at a handful of intimate UK gigs, ending last night (April 19) in London.

It was co-produced by the singer alongside\u00a0Jack Antonoff\u00a0and\u00a0Glass Animals\u00a0frontman Dave Bayley,\u00a0the latter of whom recently remixed \u2018My Love\u2019.

The track is heavily influenced by jungle music, which has roots in reggae and dancehall, so the band wanted to pay homage to its birthplace by filming in Jamaica. Speaking about the video and single, they said: \u201c\u2018Wicked and Bad\u2019 is a mosh pit, festival ready banger and when we were thinking about what the video would look like we just knew it had to be shot in Jamaica, and having complete creative control and being in complete control of the budget, we were able to just get up and do exactly that!\u201d  They continued: \u201cI [Bobby] reached out to Yannick Reid who is an incredible director in Jamaica and works with Koffee, Protoje, Lila Ike to name a few, he loved the track and came back with a vision that matched perfectly with what we were thinking, even down to the DIY flame thrower which is a cultural staple of dancehalls in Jamaica, it just fits with the song perfectly. \u201cWe used a completely local crew and I styled the outfits. Being a jungle type of track I knew I had to pull out some vintage Moschino pieces which were popular in the UK jungle raves back in the day. It\u2019s the focus track from the new album so we knew it had to make an impact when we released it and this video helps us do just that!\u201d The band caught up with NME\u00a0at the\u00a0BandLab NME Awards 2022 in March, where they spoke about the new album. They were in attendance to present the\u00a0award for Best Festival in the UK to Reading & Leeds.  \u201cIt might be big-headed to say, but there\u2019s maybe more variation than any band\u2019s album \u2013 maybe ever!\u201d said drummer Bobbie Vylan. Bob continued: \u201cIt\u2019s a conceptual piece, but it\u2019s very varied in its sonics, it\u2019s varied in its production, the lyrical content, the themes that we\u2019re exploring as well. I think it\u2019s going to be an incredible album to conceptualise what the UK is going through and will be going through in the next year to God knows how long\u2026 until this government pulls their finger out of their fucking arsehole.\u201d The band will be heading off on a full UK headline tour through May and June in support of \u2018Bob Vylan Presents The Price Of Life\u2019 \u2013 buy tickets here.

Grey and Broderick started dating in 1986 after meeting on the set of Ferris Bueller\u2019s Day Off. Grey then bagged the role of Baby in Dirty Dancing, catapulting her to new heights of stardom in Hollywood. She and Broderick were engaged to be married, but after about four years together the pair split up and Grey started dating Johnny Depp. Speaking to People\u00a0magazine, the actor \u2013 whose new memoir Out Of The Corner is released\u00a0May 3 \u2013 recalled the time Madonna threw her a 29th birthday party and on the same night shared that her 1989 hit was penned in response to her breakup with Broderick. \u201cShe told me she wrote \u2018Express Yourself\u2019 about me breaking up with Matthew,\u201d Grey said. \u201cShe played it for me in her car. I was in my log cabin with Johnny and she said, \u2018Come into my car.\u2019 And I got in her Mercedes where she had a really good sound system and she was like, \u2018Listen to this song I just did. It\u2019s about you.'\u201d A portion of the song\u2019s lyrics even makes reference to Grey\u2019s\u00a0Dirty Dancing character, Baby: \u201cYou deserve the best in life/\u00a0So if the time isn\u2019t right, then move on/\u00a0Second best is never enough/\u00a0You\u2019ll do much better, baby, on your own.\u201d Referencing the song\u2019s lyrics, Grey added: \u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned is that I demanded second best.\u201d  Grey and Madonna were close friends at the time when Grey\u2019s relationship with Depp began, and both women were cast in the 1989 film\u00a0Bloodhounds Of Broadway. Grey said\u00a0she reached out to Madonna recently about her relationship being the subject matter of the \u2018Express Yourself\u2019. \u201cI wrote her an email where I asked, \u2018Did you just tell that to everyone?'\u201d she told People. Last month, Madonna\u00a0dropped off a second remix of her song \u2018Frozen\u2019 with Canadian producer Sickick and Nigerian singer\u00a0Fireboy DML. Madonna and Sickick first released a remix of the 1998 classic \u2013 taken from the queen of pop\u2019s \u2018Ray Of Light\u2019 album \u2013 last December, which came after it went viral on TikTok.  Meanwhile, Evan Rachel Wood has been cast as Madonna in the forthcoming \u2018Weird Al\u2019 Yankovic biopic. Madonna\u2019s 1984 hit \u2018Like A Virgin\u2019 became a hit parody for Yankovic in the form of \u2018Like A Surgeon\u2019, which the pop star herself praised upon its release. "

Linkin Park have been on hiatus since the death of frontman Chester Bennington in 2017. \u201cThe only Linkin Park\u00a0news I have for you is that\u2026 Yeah, we talk every few weeks \u2013 I talk to the guys, or some of the guys,\u201d Shinoda said. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no tours, there\u2019s no music, there\u2019s no albums in the pipeline. Okay, so let me just tell you that. So just keep in your minds that that is not happening.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just gonna say that much for now,\u201d he continued. \u201cI say that because anytime the band says anything or does anything, everyone tries to start up the hype train, and we\u2019re, like, \u2018No, no, no, no.

Asked if the group would ever look for another singer,\u00a0Shinoda told Rock Antenne: \u201cThat\u2019s not my goal right now. I think it has to happen naturally. And if we find somebody that\u2019s a great person that we think is a good personality fit and a good stylistic fit, then I could see trying to do some stuff with somebody.\u201d He added that the potential line-up change wouldn\u2019t\u00a0be \u201cfor the sake of replacing\u201d Bennington, as he \u201cwouldn\u2019t wanna ever feel like we were replacing Chester\u201d. Soon after, Shinoda took to Twitter to write:\u00a0\u201cLemme clarify a rumor: we are not looking for a new singer, and if it were to happen organically, I\u2019d be open. Seems pretty clear, yet I guess some folks have a hard time understanding.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m not into predicting the future. The future will happen.\u201d  Meanwhile, Grey Daze, the band fronted by\u00a0Chester Bennington\u00a0before he went on to form\u00a0Linkin Park, announced their return earlier this month with new album \u2018The Phoenix\u2019.

            "content": "Arcade Fire have spoken about Peter Gabriel and Father John Misty\u2018s contributions to their upcoming new album, \u2018WE\u2019. The Canadian band are due to release their sixth studio effort on May 6 via Columbia Records. It was produced by long-term\u00a0Radiohead collaborator Nigel Godrich along with the group\u2019s Win Butler and Re\u0301gine Chassagne. During a recent interview with the Montreal Gazette, it was noted that Gabriel contributed to a dance-orientated album track called \u2018Unconditional II (Race and Religion)\u2019 on which Chassagne takes the lead. \u201c[Gabriel] came to the studio and we had a day to work on it,\u201d Butler told the outlet. \u201cHe does this thing where he double-tracks his voice, high and low. As soon as he put the high vocal down, I was like, \u2018Oh s\u2014, that\u2019s Peter Gabriel\u2019.\u201d In a separate conversation with The New York Times, Butler and Chassagne said it was gratifying to spend time with an artist who had a similar approach to pursuing music. \u201cWe feel crazy sometimes,\u201d Butler explained. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to meet other people that know what we\u2019re talking about.\u201d Chassagne, meanwhile, said it was \u201cso special\u201d to hear the finished collaboration. Arcade Fire. CREDIT: Michael Marcelle Elsewhere in their chat with the Montreal Gazette, Butler opened up about the experience of him and Chassagne being separated from their bandmates as the couple worked on new material throughout the pandemic. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know when or if it would be possible to get the band together. We were very inspired and very plugged in, but the world we were making the record for was changing so much,\u201d Butler remembered. In the NYT\u2019s interview, it was revealed that Joshua Tillman \u2013 aka Father John Misty \u2013 flew in from Los Angeles to act as an external \u201csounding board\u201d for Butler and Chassagne early on in the songwriting process. Butler told the Montreal Gazette: \u201cThe goal was to write \u2014 independent of genre \u2014 songs we could play around the piano with guitar, and to just work on structure, melody and the bones of songs as much as we could, because we had time.\u201d Six months later, Butler and Chassagne reunited with the rest of the band and \u2018WE\u2019 started to properly come together. \u201cEvery night, I would grill food and we would sit around the fire and play songs,\u201d the frontman recalled. \u201cIt was a very uncertain but beautiful time.\u201d Peter Gabriel previously covered Arcade Fire\u2019s \u2018My Body Is A Cage\u2019, with Butler and co. later returning the favour by recording a rendition of the former Genesis musician\u2019s solo track \u2018Games Without Frontiers\u2019. Back in 2015, Father John Misty put his own spin on Arcade Fire\u2019s 2010 song \u2018The Suburbs\u2019 from their Grammy-winning third album of the same name.  Arcade Fire have previewed \u2018WE\u2019 with the double lead single \u2018The Lightning I, II\u2019 and are expected to release \u2018Unconditional I (Lookout Kid)\u2019 soon. The band played the forthcoming track during their surprise Coachella set last weekend. The group will make their return to the UK next Friday (April 29) to play an intimate concert at London\u2019s KOKO to mark the long-awaited reopening of the venue. Tickets are now sold out. "

The former One Direction star returned to the California festival\u2019s second consecutive weekend to deliver another headline performance after making his debut appearance on April 15. Towards the end of his main set, Styles surprised the crowd by welcoming Lizzo to the stage to cover Gloria Gaynor\u2019s 1978 disco anthem \u2018I Will Survive\u2019. The pair strutted down the runway in flamboyant matching coats, belting out the tune as they went.

It was subsequently reported that the pop star\u2019s Coachella crowd had surpassed a huge 100,000 people.  In a four-star review of Styles\u2019 weekend one show, NME\u00a0wrote: \u201c[\u2026] It\u2019s clear that he\u2019s no longer aiming for the rock star lane, but is firmly blazing his own path through it.\u201d Check back at NME\u00a0all weekend for more reviews, news, interviews, photos and more from Coachella 2022.\u00a0 "

            "content": "Tom Grennan has shared an update after being attacked in New York, while thanking fans for their \u201cincredible\u201d support. The singer-songwriter was hospitalised following an \u201cunprovoked attack and robbery\u201d outside a bar in Manhattan after playing a headline show in New York City. As a result, he was forced to postpone his scheduled performance in Washington, D.C. yesterday (April 22). In a statement, his management wrote: \u201cTom is currently in hospital being assessed by doctors for his injuries which include a ruptured ear, torn eardrum and issue with his previously fractured jaw.\u201d The message went on to say that Grennan was \u201cin good spirits but needs to temporarily recuperate whilst doctors assess his ability to continue with touring\u201d. With Grennan\u2019s North American tour due to resume in Boston, Massachusetts this evening (April 23), the singer has posted a video message on social media in which he spoke about the incident and his ongoing recovery. \u201cI thought I\u2019d come on here and let you know that I\u2019m all good,\u201d Grennan said. \u201cThe support that I\u2019ve been seeing is unbelievable and very overwhelming, and I can\u2019t believe it. So thank you so much. \u201cThe [last] 24 hours has been crazy; it\u2019s been madness, to be honest with you. But I thought I\u2019d come on here and let you know what actually went on. It was just wrong place, wrong time.\u201d A message from Tom \ud83d\udc9a\u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/GAnsBLNvQW \u2014 Tom Grennan (@Tom_Grennan) April 22, 2022  Grennan continued: \u201cI was punched, knocked out and I woke up and was like, \u2018Whoa, what went on?'\u201d The musician went on to confirm that he has a ruptured eardrum, \u201ca bit of concussion\u201d and is currently on medication. \u201cLuckily enough, my jaw\u2019s fine,\u201d he said. Grennan has since filed a police report, saying that the NYPD were \u201cbrilliant\u201d. As for his next gig, Grennan explained that his fans are his \u201cmain priority\u201d and said he doesn\u2019t want to cancel the tour: \u201cThe show must go on, and I\u2019m gonna do all that I can to get to Boston.\u201d He added: \u201cBut thank you so much. It\u2019s been incredible to see how much people show love and support. I\u2019m all good, I promise you. It\u2019s gonna take a couple of weeks \u2013 hopefully \u2013 for the ear to be on the mend, but we\u2019ll see. We\u2019ve just got to keep the show running.\u201d You can watch the video message in the tweet above.

            "title": "Sergio Vega on why he left Deftones: \u201cIt was never about money, it was about a sense of belonging\u201d",
            "content": "Sergio Vega has opened up about his recent departure from Deftones, saying he left the Californian alt-metal outfit back in March because it didn\u2019t offer him \u201ca sense of belonging\u201d. Vega first performed with Deftones in 1999, filling in for bassist Chi Chang on a tour preceding their \u2018White Pony\u2019 release. After a serious car accident forced Chang to leave the band in 2008, Vega was brought as his full-time replacement. He appeared on the last four of Deftones\u2019 studio albums, starting with 2010\u2019s \u2018Diamond Eyes\u2019 and most recently, 2020\u2019s \u2018Ohms\u2019.\u00a0 But in a new interview with the Talk Toomey podcast (transcribed by The PRP), Vega alleged that he was never formally made an official member of the band. He explained: \u201cOver the years, it started to become like \u2018Hey I would really like to belong to this,\u2019 and whenever it would come up, it was really more like they were good with the status quo.\u201d The bassist \u2013 who also performs in Quicksand, and has a solo project of his own \u2013 went on to say that his exit from Deftones was \u201cnot financial\u201d, noting that although the band wouldn\u2019t agree to include Vega in their formal business dealings, they did offer him a raise.\u00a0 He continued: \u201cIt was never about money, it was about a sense of belonging. So that was really it. And ultimately, in parting ways, it was not a function of me trying to renegotiate during the pandemic. It was a function of the contract being cancelled. And me having a little conversation with Chino [Moreno, vocals/rhythm guitar], and then another conversation with a couple of the guys saying \u2018hey\u2019 when they wanted to reinstate [the contract]. \u201cI was like, \u2018I think the path forward is that we can all be in the same boat. Now would be the time to get off this type of structure. Because it\u2019s not really working for anybody, especially now when we\u2019re not touring, we\u2019re not doing anything. And it doesn\u2019t make sense to have this type of structure, it\u2019s been twelve years at this point and let\u2019s make good on that. I just can\u2019t go onto the salary thing because it\u2019s not working for us\u2019. And that was it.\u201d Expounding on his experience of feeling like an outsider in the group, Vega said: \u201cIt\u2019s the security and stability of feeling like you\u2019re a part of something that you\u2019re investing in, and belonging. To me the keyword is this feeling that you belong. Something that you\u2019re pouring yourself into. Now, had it been from the get go, \u2018This is the vibe, this it the help that we need,\u2019 then that\u2019s cool\u2026\u00a0 \u201cBut at the end of the day, I guess the perception of it encroaching on anyone\u2019s income could have been the thing that allowed it to not come together.\u201d In addition to his continued activity in Quicksand \u2013 who released their fourth album, \u2018Distant Populations\u2019, last August\u2019 \u2013 Vega is currently working on a series of elusive new endeavours, including \u201ca single-based project\u201d with Spotlights drummer Chris Enriquez.\u00a0  Detailing the unique way that project operates, Vega explained: \u201c[We] get with a singer, [we] talk a little bit about a vibe, and we write a song together. And that\u2019s it. We write and record the song, we give it a little digital component\u2026 It was kind of inspired by an Argentine hip-hop producer, who has this series of songs that he does with a lot of artists.\u00a0 \u201c[It\u2019s] mostly rappers and some singers \u2013 [he] does a song, records it, that\u2019s it. It\u2019s a series. And the idea of building that as a modality in this kind of music was really, really exciting.\u00a0 You don\u2019t have the thing of trying to build the band. You don\u2019t have to deal with the time conflicts with the people you may want to work with, it opens up a lot.\u00a0 \u201cSo currently we have a song done. We have [another] one almost done. And then last week we started working on a track with [former Every Time I Die frontman] Keith Buckley. It\u2019s super exciting because we got on the phone and we just talked about life. He, Chris and I had a quick FaceTime. We hadn\u2019t met each other, [but] obviously [we\u2019re] well aware of each other. And we really, really hit it off. So it\u2019s a rare time that I feel compelled to mention the person because of the situation.\u201d Earlier this month, Deftones unveiled their new touring line-up, with former Marilyn Manson bassist Fred Sablan taking Vega\u2019s old role.
