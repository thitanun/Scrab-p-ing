I always say that I want to live like the wind. I want to live each and every day with excitement, and I want to go where my heart is drawn towards regardless of where that is. \u2018Windy\u2019 is an album that tells the story that my alter ego \u2018Windy\u2019 wants to tell.\u201d \u00a0 When talking about producing and performing on stage, the idol shared: \u201cIt\u2019s really thrilling to stand on the stage, but the feeling of satisfaction when the project I produced comes out well overall is really great. I\u2019m working hard to fulfill the wishes of Jeon Soyeon on stage as well as the producer Jeon Soyeon. I can work really hard. Rather than giving just the song, I want to be a producer that creates the general concept together.\u201d \u00a0 When asked if she had any doubts or fears before making her solo debut, the singer said: \u201cI trust in my intuition. I originally had doubts since everything I want to do can\u2019t all be right. However, the company CEO supported me by saying, \u2018Soyeon appears to have great sense, so trust in your intuition,\u2019 and I got the thought that my feeling of wanting to do something could become a reason.

You need to have days that some people might call useless in order to focus better on the days where you do useful things.\u201d \u00a0 The singer also opened up about his aversion to seriousness, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s no fun. Of course, I\u2019m serious about work. But aside from when I\u2019m on stage, I spend about 80 to 90 percent of the time joking around.

You\u2019ve accomplished amazing things.\u2019 But I still have a hard time accepting that. If someone were to ask me what sets me apart from other people, I wouldn\u2019t have much to say other than \u2018I\u2019m a member of BTS.'\u201d \u00a0 When asked about how he keeps moving forward, Jin said: \u201cIf I focus on my everyday life, I naturally wind up forgetting and moving forward. In the past, I used to sort of distinguish between BTS\u2019s Jin and the person Kim Seokjin, but I don\u2019t anymore.

That can be true. I\u2019m grateful for those opportunities, but I think of this in two ways. There are roles that are suitable for people who first debuted as singers and roles that are not given to people who first debuted as singers. There were times when the production company or the director would say, \u2018Sooyoung is really good but this role is not suitable for someone who comes from a music background.'\u201d \u00a0 She also added, \u201cBut there are times when I watch movies and can\u2019t see myself replacing some of those actors who have done nothing but movie acting all their lives. I have to think logically about what choices I need to make to be an actor with lots of different paths open to her.\u201d \u00a0 Sooyoung also looked at a few other idols-turned-actors who have paved the way in filmography with their serious roles. She said: \u201cBeing a singer-turned-actor is both an advantage and a disadvantage. But I don\u2019t think that my singing background is necessarily always going to block me from getting certain roles. There are people like Im Siwan and Do Kyung Soo [EXO\u2019s D.O.].
