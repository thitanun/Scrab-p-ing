            "title": "Pop 2.0: how globalised music created a new kind of star",
            "content": "In a recent episode of the New York Times Popcast, the paper\u2019s critic, Jon Caramanica, recalled the week in August where K-pop seven-piece BTS and Puerto Rican star Ozuna\u2019s respective albums debuted inside the US Top 10. \u201cI remember looking at that and being, like, oh, this is it \u2013 this is the new pop order. This is not seven sub-genres ascending: this is pop.\u201d Here were two acts who had vaulted western pop\u2019s language barrier: BTS are currently the world\u2019s biggest boyband; Ozuna sings and raps, tackles reggaeton, bachata, Latin trap and plain old pop with equal ease, and was YouTube\u2019s most streamed artist in the world in 2018. Numbers two and three in YouTube\u2019s list were J Balvin and Bad Bunny, two more singer-rappers who primarily perform in Spanish. And, incidentally, eight of the 10 most viewed songs of 2018 were by Spanish-speaking acts. What Caramanica noticed was a fundamental change to the idea that English is pop\u2019s lingua franca. This development has been accompanied by a remarkable shift in the pop-star system itself. While bilingual artists surge into charts and playlists, joining the American rappers who have profoundly reshaped popular music in the last 20 years (the five most listened-to tracks on Spotify in 2018 were by US hip-hop acts), it\u2019s a different story for the stars who emerged during the era we might call Pop 1.0. \u201cThe massive pop stars of yesteryear \u2013 Katy Perry, Justin Timberlake \u2013 are fading from the public consciousness,\u201d wrote New Yorker critic Amanda Petrusich in a review of a Taylor Swift concert film, premiered by Netflix on New Year\u2019s Eve. Though the review is broadly sympathetic toward Swift, Petrusich suggests that despite the singer\u2019s continuing immense popularity as a live act, she\u2019s pushing an aesthetic that is outdated. Moreover, Petrusich seems to imply, so are the other superstars \u2013 Perry, Justin Bieber, Britney Spears, Madonna \u2013 who stage similarly alpha tours. These \u201cmassive pop stars of yesteryear\u201d adhere to a model established in the early 80s. The industry infrastructure \u2013 radio, MTV, record shops, press, awards ceremonies \u2013 created an unprecedented level of fame for the top artists, especially the trinity of Madonna, Prince and Michael Jackson. They were the unassailable pantechnicons around whom the idea of pop stardom revolved, establishing the template for Mariah Carey, Timberlake, Spears and Jennifer Lopez \u2013 right up to today\u2019s Perry, Swift, Bieber and Lady Gaga. The latter might be the final Pop 1.0 star to have owned the zeitgeist while at her peak, and it says much about her prescience today that she has dissociated from the aloof figure she cut in her imperial phase. The music was vocally driven, melody prevailing over beats, verses almost always leading to choruses. It could be pensive or euphoric; it might toy with exotica or exhibit social awareness; it was open to advances in technology (Carey\u2019s wholly traditional-sounding All I Want for Christmas Is You, for instance, was made entirely with computers \u2013 sleigh bells and all). The main thing, whether it was a frothy Madonna bop, an oily Prince sex romp or Gaga making like a shard of Auto-Tuned ice, was that the artist\u2019s presence was all over it. You knew who you were listening to: the song was in the service of the singer \u2013 not, as is often the case today with fluid genres such as trap, the other way around. As we approach the end of the decade, streaming, which skews heavily toward hip-hop, is the most popular way of hearing music. The average 12-year-old has never known genre boundaries and is likely to be listening to everyone from Cardi B to BTS to platinum-selling American singer Becky G, who has only returned to singing in English after three years of exclusively Spanish releases. Against that, the once omnipresent 1.0 acts represent a mindset that feels outmoded. A bit hubristic and mainly white, that mentality is battling the fluidity of the new guard. Led by rappers and global acts, the 2.0 cohort are oblivious to genre rules: they pop up on each other\u2019s records, singing in Spanish or Korean or French, and they speak directly to fans via social media. Balvin, Drake, BTS and fellow K-pop hunks Monsta X, Cardi B, the currently ubiquitous Post Malone, Bad Bunny \u2013 all have their own styles, yet are adaptable; they\u2019re enormously popular, but by the rules of the old music business, ungovernable. The old riot grrrl slogan, \u201cThis is happening without your permission\u201d, feels apt. While they\u2019re as ambitious as any old-guard star (\u201cwe want everybody to love the album, even though they don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m saying,\u201d Balvin said (in English) last year), they\u2019re achieving their aims by being relatable. To audiences whose entry-level pop star was Cardi B or Drake, artists are supposed to be relatable, and to meet them halfway by exposing their lives on Instagram and putting out new music as it\u2019s ready rather than sticking to rigid release schedules. The artificial star/fan distinctions that made Madonna and Jackson feel unreachable no longer exist. Non-anglophone artists can thrive in this ecosystem. I\u2019ve seen it for myself: in 2018, I reviewed London shows by Balvin, pop-reggaeton golden boy Maluma, Monsta X and BTS. The venues heaved with excited young Londoners, who sang along, lofted flags and generally did their nut over being in the same room as their heroes \u2013 all of which is par for the course at pop shows. What was different was that almost none of the songs were in English, and most of the fans couldn\u2019t understand the lyrics. And here was the thing: that was absolutely fine, posing no barrier to loving the music. If anything captured this remarkable new order, it was my friend\u2019s BTS-stanning 14-year-old daughter, who spent the show singing every song. After discovering the group via social media a couple of years earlier, she decided to learn Korean and had now mastered enough to understand the songs. Having a grasp of the language is also useful for following K-pop bands on social media, where fresh content is uploaded hourly, much of it solely in Korean. The more switched-on 1.0 stars have been clambering over each other to collaborate with the 2.0s: Bieber shoehorned his way on to the Despacito remix (though the Luis Fonsi-Daddy Yankee original is vastly more popular on YouTube, with 6bn streams compared to the Bieber version\u2019s 600m). Perry got trap superstars Migos aboard her current album and Lopez collaborated with Bad Bunny on her 2018 single Te Guste. And you can bet that Madonna\u2019s new album, due this year, will acknowledge 2.0. Spare a thought for the old guard. How could traditional pop superstars not feel they were singularly special when they\u2019ve spent their careers being treated like emperors? Each new album or tour was the subject of a campaign planned a year in advance, and no promotional gesture was too grandiose. Jackson, to name one glorious example, set out on his 1996 HIStory tour with a nine-metre statue of himself. On the first date, in Prague, it was displayed on a plinth formerly occupied by the Stalin monument. Compare that to Drake, arguably the Jacko of today in terms of stature and influence: his 2016 single One Dance arrived without an official video and still spent 10 weeks at the top of the US chart, and 15 weeks at No 1 in the UK. Meanwhile, ever since Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s surprise 2013 LP, rap and R&B artists have turned the album-release playbook on its head by putting out albums whenever they decide it\u2019s time, even if it means doing so with no warning other than a few judicious leaks. The \u201csurprise\u201d release is now so common that it\u2019s becoming less useful as a strategy, but maybe that doesn\u2019t matter: whenever an album emerges, fans will come, or they won\u2019t. The 1.0 stars often outperform the newer ones on the live circuit, where the hubbub about streaming figures and globalism means relatively little. Swift\u2019s 2018 tour was the second highest grossing in the US last year, taking $315m. First place went to her friend Ed Sheeran, on $429m. It\u2019s worth noting that Sheeran is unusual in having staked places in both the 1.0 and 2.0 camps. His traditional songcraft marks him as old school, but long-term alliances with rappers and Afrobeat stars such as Fuse ODG suggest that he could survive any 1.0 clearout. But the live industry might as well be another galaxy: included in 2018\u2019s 10 top grossers are country singer Kenny Chesney, the Rolling Stones and a Journey-Def Leppard double-header, none of whom stream particularly well or pretend to be any cooler than they are. A flourishing gig market is one of the only reliable holdovers from the golden past. Artists have taken advantage of this market by bundling a copy of their new album with every ticket \u2013 not as an inducement to buy tickets, which will be snapped up regardless, but to help their new album achieve a better chart position. So which of the \u201cmassive stars of yesteryear\u201d will stick it out? Most likely, it will be the adaptable ones \u2013 artists who don\u2019t just piggyback on to prevailing styles but have an affinity with them. Sheeran is probably safe, as is Grande, whose move toward trap and R&B has been seamless and convincing. The sense that the 1.0 era is over is solidified by the lack of superstars-in-waiting. Bebe Rexha, Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello and Dua Lipa, as fine as their efforts might be, aren\u2019t cut from the same lordly cloth as their forebears. The cultural environment in which they find themselves militates against pop gods \u2013 just imagine if Michael Jackson had turned up with that statue now. "

            "title": "Kris Wu: Antares review \u2013 algorithmic rap karaoke from ex-boyband star",
            "content": "A massive star in Asia, actor, model and singer Kris Wu first found fame with Chinese-Korean boyband Exo, who were so phenomenally popular they once sold out an arena concert in 1.47 seconds. He left because \u201cthey feed you music and you just kinda do it, you don\u2019t have freedom\u201d, and is now releasing his solo debut, which has all the hallmarks of an artist who is still creatively shackled, whether by a language barrier or a lack of original artistry. Wu has turned away from the selection-box pop of Exo and honed in on a US rap sound, aping the warbling, microdosed delivery of Travis Scott (who guests on Deserve), the triplet time of Quavo, and the croon of Drake in soft-boy mode. There\u2019s nothing theoretically wrong with these simulacra \u2013 Wu shouldn\u2019t feel obliged to bring in tangibly Asian sonics to differentiate his work \u2013 but his blank boyband voice simply isn\u2019t as characterful as those he\u2019s aping. His mostly English lyrics are hip-hop Huel, a beige stock of cliches and signifiers that becomes embarrassing: the clean-cut Wu is audibly not a \u201csavage\u201d, and his complaint of \u201csuicide when I can\u2019t see my shorty\u201d is crass and stupid. There is a sing-song catchiness to the melody of that line on November Rain, and a feathery lightness to Wu\u2019s delivery on Explore, but the blankness of the lyrics makes it all feel pointless. Producers such as the usually brilliant Murda Beatz, meanwhile, turn in thin work that has clearly been knocking around subfolders for some time. This algorithmic rap karaoke is a misjudged use of Wu\u2019s pop smarts.  "

Three schoolfriends originally formed the group\u2019s skeleton in 2012 \u2013 guitarist and songwriter Kim Byung-kyu, bassist Ha Jae-young, and drummer Kang Se-min \u2013 before they introduced themselves to Choi Su-mi at a Busan teashop, after loving the lilting tones of her speaking voice. Two years later, her wistful, subtly edgy vocals lit up We\u2019ve Sobered Up, a debut album full of songs with sounds \u2013 and song titles \u2013 ripe for nostalgic teen movies (Bad Feeling and I Know I\u2019m Kind of Boring are among the best). An EP, Big Summer Night, followed, but in 2015 came a tragedy that would break many bands: their drummer ruptured his skull after an accidental fall and was left in a coma. They took two years off in shock but regrouped to release an EP named after him, Semin, which raised funds for his medical care. They also finished the album they began with him, When We Were Together. Its seven-minute finale Coming to the End is a slow-building, quiet-to-loud, Yo La Tengo epic, culminating in Se-min\u2019s last recording on drums. Now they have released a new single, George & Janice, full of the hopeful brightness of bands like the Concretes. A new album comes in 2020, and they embark on a seven-date UK tour later this month. Say Sue Me tour the UK from 23 September to 2 October "

            "title": "Singapore suspends crypto exchange over row with K-pop band BTS",
            "content": "Singapore\u2019s financial regulator has reportedly suspended Bitget, a crypto exchange that is mired in a row involving South Korea\u2019s biggest boyband, BTS. Bitget has removed the Monetary Authority of Singapore\u2019s logo from its website, the Guardian confirmed. The platform still claims to have licences from Australia, Canada and the United States, according to its website. According to a Financial Times report on Sunday, Bitget was suspended after it got into a high-profile dispute for promoting the digital currency Army Coin, which is named after the band\u2019s followers, who are known as the BTS army. In October, the platform was threatened with legal action by the BTS management company, Hybe Corporation, for promoting Army Coin to traders using an unauthorised image of the band and distributing what it said was false information that the coin was made for BTS and intended to maximise its profits. BTS made history earlier this year after being named global recording artist of the year for 2020 by the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, becoming the first act that performs in a language other than English to top the annual ranking. In a statement at the time, Hybe said the coin had \u201cno affiliation\u201d with BTS and urged anyone who had suffered financial damage linked to Army Coin to file a report at their nearest police station. \u201cWe are currently reviewing legal violations, including the infringing of an artist\u2019s portrait right, without consulting with the company, and we will take all legal action against infringements and violations.\u201d Founded in Singapore in 2018, Bitget sponsors the Italian football team Juventus, and claims to have more than 1.5 million users worldwide. Its website claims the business was valued at more than $1bn (about \u00a3760m) in the latest financing round.  The platform reported that as of 30 November, it had 11,626 traders handling a 24-hour trading volume of $4bn. It introduced a Turkish website on 5 November. The episode illustrates the complexity and transnational nature of cryptocurrencies, and comes as the Asian city state seeks to establish itself as the world\u2019s leading digital currency centre. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) said last month it was introducing \u201cstrong regulation\u201d for companies that dealt with cryptocurrencies. \u201cWith crypto-based activities, it is basically an investment in a prospective future, the shape of which is not clear at this point,\u201d said Ravi Menon, the managing director of MAS, in an interview with Bloomberg. He added: \u201cBut not to get into this game, I think risks Singapore being left behind. Getting early into that game means we can have a head start, and better understand its potential benefits as well as its risks.\u201d Bitget has been contacted for comment. "

But occasionally I feel I wouldn\u2019t mind a day back in my pimpled young body so I could hide among them and try to figure out what they\u2019re up to these days. Until someone can 13 Going on 30 (And the Rest) me in real life, I will have to make do with documentaries like James Ballardie\u2019s K-Pop Idols: Inside the Hit Factory (BBC Four), which tracks the rise of the South Korean music genre that increasingly holds younger generations in its thrall. Would-be stars are trained, sometimes from the age of 11, to become part of the squeaky-clean and slickly choreographed phalanx of performers who deliver gobbets of hooky, high-energy material via perfectly produced videos. They are trained, like footballers or Russian gymnasts, to be all they can be. Or at least all their producers want them to be. Anyone over the age of 15 won\u2019t be able to tell them apart, but that\u2019s almost the point. Ballardie lightly traces the history: western music first made its influence felt in Korea via the US presence there during the war, before being clamped down on, along with everything else, after the 1961 coup by Park Chung-hee. But by the early 90s, democracy had been sufficiently restored to let Seo Taiji and the Boys \u2013 a Boyz II Men or New Kids on the Block-style boyband \u2013 appear on television and give South Korea its Beatles moment. Their first song spent 17 weeks at No 1 and kickstarted a phenomenon. Now, K-pop videos rack up millions of views online, adoring fans synchronise their chants at concerts, K-pop museums flourish \u2013 and thousands attend open auditions to become the next big pink-haired thing. The show goes behind the scenes to give a sense of the indefatigability of those involved. The peoples\u2019 optimism, which is both the effect of living in a post-communist country that has moved from one of the poorest to the 11th richest in the world over the last 40 years, was on display everywhere. Songwriters of all nationalities gather in Seoul to make hits for the big stars, while the idols are mastering social media and mobilising fans with ever greater efficiency. If we\u2019re not quite living in K-pop\u2019s world yet, we will be soon. Conspicuous by its absence, however, is much analysis of the phenomenon \u2013 especially the acknowledgement of any possible downside to an industry involving young people, older svengalis controlling everything from dance moves to diets, and pots of money to be made. The K-pop system is so glaringly ripe for abuse that the absence of any discussion about it actually becomes distracting. Ballardie does touch on a few sensitive points \u2013 the career-ending arrest of one star allegedly involved with all sorts of nefarious activities through a nightclub he owned and the recent passing of legislation to protect young people from exploitation. But even allowing for the fact that the documentary was designed as a primer on the subject, the apparent willingness to believe the hype \u2013 and to be charmed by people who have been schooled in compliance \u2013 did make for a pretty thin hour. Now, bring me my bath chair and rug. I feel the cold. "

            "content": "A Jewish human rights organisation has condemned the K-pop band BTS over photographs of them wearing Nazi-style hats. The Simon Wiesenthal Center accused BTS of \u201cmocking the past\u201d The band were dropped from a Japanese TV show last week after one of its members wore a T-shirt that appeared to celebrate the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. \u201cWearing a T-shirt in Japan mocking the victims of the \u2026 A-bomb, is just the latest incident of this band mocking the past,\u201d Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the associate dean of the Los Angeles-based centre, said in a statement. Cooper referred to the release in early 2015 of teasers for a photo-book that showed a member of the band wearing a hat featuring the symbol of the Death\u2019s Head Units \u2013 SS organisations that administered the Nazi concentration camps. The statement also linked to images of band members posing at the Holocaust memorial in Berlin and to footage of them waving large flags on stage that were \u201ceerily similar\u201d to the Nazi swastika. \u201cIt goes without saying that this group, which was invited to speak at the UN, owes the people of Japan and the victims of the Nazism an apology,\u201d Cooper said. \u201cBut that is not enough. It is clear that those designing and promoting this group\u2019s career are too comfortable with denigrating the memory of the past. The result is that young generations in Korea and around the world are more likely to identify bigotry and intolerance as being \u2018cool\u2019 and help erase the lessons of history. The management of this group, not only the front performers, should publicly apologise.\u201d Last Friday, the Japanese network TV Asahi abruptly cancelled BTS\u2019s scheduled appearance on its flagship Music Station show after being alerted to a photograph of Jimin, 23, wearing a T-shirt featuring a slogan celebrating Korea\u2019s liberation from Japanese colonial rule in August 1945. The words were accompanied by an image of a mushroom cloud generated by an exploding atomic bomb. Japan surrendered on 15 August that year, days after the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. BTS, who have been described as the biggest boyband in the world, apologised to their Japanese fans for the cancellation but made no mention of the T-shirt. They have not publicly responded to Cooper\u2019s criticism. Lee Taek-gwang, a cultural critic, said the incidents were a symptom of modern South Korea\u2019s struggle to reconcile strong nationalist sentiment with its growing international profile. \u201cBTS insist they are a global brand, but their identity is rooted in Korean nationalism, as it is with many young South Koreans,\u201d said Lee, a professor at Kyung Hee University in Seoul, adding that nationalism continued to define the collective memory of Japan\u2019s colonial rule of the Korean peninsula from 1910-45. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just the case of a young band doing something stupid,\u201d Lee said. While overt support for the Nazis remained taboo in South Korea, the use of symbols associated with Nazism did not prompt the same level of outrage there as they did in many other countries, he said. \u201cYoung Koreans come across as liberal and cosmopolitan, but beneath the surface there are more reactionary factors at work.\u201d The cancellation of the band\u2019s TV appearance came five months after they became the first K-pop band to top the Billboard 200 album chart with Love Yourself: Tear. Last week their ninth single in Japan, Fake Love/Airplane pt 2, was No 1 in the country\u2019s Oricon daily singles chart. The band, who won the music group award at the People\u2019s Choice Awards in Los Angeles at the weekend, performed in Paris last month in front of the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, with whom they later posed for photos. They have also played to large audiences in London and New York. The controversies come amid a sharp deterioration in relations between Tokyo and Seoul, where some politicians have accused the band\u2019s Japanese critics of overreacting. Noting that other TV stations were reconsidering planned appearances by BTS, a spokesman for the ruling Democratic party said it would be inappropriate to do so \u201con political grounds\u201d. The opposition Liberty Korea party voiced \u201cdeep regret towards Japan\u2019s intolerant cultural relativism and insular historical awareness\u201d, according to the Korea Herald. "

Instead of a support act, the pre-show warm-up is simply a playlist of the band\u2019s lavish videos (YouTube views currently stand at more than 6bn), some of which feature the tour\u2019s sponsor, Kia, which is later awkwardly namechecked on stage. The mention is cheered as hysterically as anything that comes out of the mouths of Jennie, Jisoo, Lisa or Ros\u00e9, with the screams almost drowning out a frenetic opening salvo featuring shape-shifting trap banger Ddu-Du Ddu-Du (performed again during the encore via a PC Music-esque remix), and the EDM-adjacent Forever Young.

Unfortunately, just four songs in, the momentum stalls as the show transforms into Korea\u2019s Got Talent. In K-pop, perhaps to help maintain the brand, band members are often encouraged to go solo, even if it\u2019s just for five minutes. So Ros\u00e9 covers the Beatles\u2019 Let It Be, Lisa (the band\u2019s true star) dances to Jason Derulo\u2019s Swalla, Jisoo wails through Zedd\u2019s Clarity while perched on crushed disco balls and Jennie performs her own solo single, Solo (key lyric: \u201cI\u2019m going solo\u201d). It\u2019s a blessed relief when they reunite for futuristic military anthem Kill This Love \u2013 but while its accompanying video is an expensive visual feast, its performance here feels disappointingly basic, with the four backing dancers doing their best to fill the stage. While there are brilliant moments throughout \u2013 the effervescent Dua Lipa collaboration Kiss and Make Up and a riotous Boombayah, in which the band\u2019s precision-engineered choreography is loosened up \u2013 the overall feeling is of a missed opportunity. K-pop, in all its bold and beautiful belligerence, runs in contrast to western pop\u2019s emotional insularity. But this show doesn\u2019t take enough risks. Blackpink have the world at their feet \u2013 they just have to give a little more back. "

The body of the 28-year-old, a former member of the girl group Kara, was found early on Sunday evening, South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency reported. Police said they were trying to establish the cause of death. Goo\u2019s death comes six months after her manager found her unconscious at her home, in what local media described as an apparent suicide attempt. The singer and actor later apologised to fans and recently relaunched her solo career with a tour of Japan and the release of a new single. Last year, Goo took her former boyfriend to court after he threatened to release footage of them having sex that was filmed without her knowledge or consent. Molka \u2013 in which women are covertly filmed and the footage uploaded to websites \u2013 has reached epidemic levels in South Korea, prompting calls for the government to take tougher action against offenders, who are almost always men. In 2017, a reported 6,400 cases of illegal filming were reported to police, up from 2,400 in 2012. Early last month, South Korean media reported that a woman had killed herself after she discovered that she had been secretly filmed in a hospital changing room. Goo\u2019s death comes weeks after the death of her close friend and fellow K-pop star Sulli turned the spotlight on the darkest corners of the K-pop industry and the online abuse directed at celebrities by \u201ctoxic\u201d fans. Sulli, a former member of the group f(x), had spoken publicly about her mental health problems and shock at her death sparked calls for greater support for performers. A number of South Korean celebrities have killed themselves in the last decade. They include Jang Ja-yeon, a popular soap star who died in 2009, leaving a seven-page letter in which she claimed she had been the victim of sexual abuse by powerful men. The K-pop star Jonghyun, whose real name was Kim Jong-hyun, killed himself in December 2017. Other artists have called for a change in the anonymous commenting culture on the internet, including Kwon Ji-an, a singer and painter better known by her stage name Solbi, who was subjected to cyber-insults in 2009 while she was a member of K-pop group Typhoon. She had also been wrongly identified in a sex video that was widely shared online. In the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

            "content": "Singer Lee Hee-moon has explained that SsingSsing are updating an ancient Korean shamanic tradition, and that \u201cthe male shamans \u2026 as mediums need more than a single sexual identity because they\u2019re channeling both male and female spirits\u201d. But if this means folk music with cross-dressing, it\u2019s also a theatrical and highly entertaining brand of glam rock, with echoes of anyone from the New York Dolls to Scissor Sisters. Lee came on stage for this opening night of the K-Music festival sporting a white wig, black dress and black gloves and began with what sounded like a melodic folk-rock ballad, with sturdy backing provided by electric guitar, drums and bass. And then the party began. He was joined by the gangling Seung-tae Shin, who also opted for a white wig, with hotpants and heels, and a female singer, the sassy Da-hye Chu, for a funk workout that showed off their slick harmony singing but was most remarkable for the deadpan, rhythmic bursts of laughter from Shin. SsingSsing\u2019s songs are written by the bass player and film music composer Young-gyu Jang, who transforms Korean traditional themes with his memorable, stomping riffs. It\u2019s fusion music that\u2019s also enormous fun, and the audience were on their feet for much of the set. The K-Music festival showcases experimental Korean music and has helped launch the international careers of Jambinai and Black String. SssingSsing should be next \u2013 if they stay together. Is it true that they won\u2019t talk to the press because they are about to break up? I was told the issue was \u201cvery sensitive\u201d. Which seems crazy \u2013 the band would go down a storm at the summer festivals. "

            "content": "Another K-pop act has sparked outrage in China after members of the globally popular girl band Blackpink were shown holding a baby panda \u2013 drawing accusations that they had risked harming the health of a national treasure. Last month, the K-pop phenomenon BTS were criticised in China after the band\u2019s leader, RM, cited the \u201chistory of pain\u201d shared between South Korea and the US, who fought alongside each other in the Korean war. China came to the aid of North Korean forces during the 1950-53 conflict and suffered significant losses. The four members of Blackpink, whose 2019 single Kill This Love has just surpassed 1.1bn views on YouTube, were shown holding Fu Bao, the first panda to be born in South Korea, as part of a trailer for their online reality show, \u201c24/365 with Blackpink\u201d. The cub, which was introduced to the public last week, was born in July to parents who arrived in South Korea from Sichuan province in 2016 as part of China\u2019s \u201cpanda diplomacy\u201d. The footage prompted some Chinese media and online commentators to denounce the artists for touching Fu Bao without wearing sanitary gloves, saying it threatened the cub\u2019s health. Users of Weibo, China\u2019s version of Twitter, joined in the criticism. Posts referencing the incident have received millions of views, and generated tens of thousands of posts with a hashtag accusing the group of incorrectly handling the animal. The hashtags \u201cBlackpink\u201d and \u201cpanda\u201d were trending on South Korean Twitter over the weekend, with some users urging the country to return the pandas, while others complained that the animals are not native to South Korea and cost too much to raise. Blackpink\u2019s music label, YG Entertainment, said it had postponed showing the full version of the show, which had been due to appear on the band\u2019s YouTube channel this week. But it said the video had been filmed with zookeepers and veterinarians present, and that every precaution had been taken to protect the panda\u2019s health. \u201cWhen Blackpink met the baby panda, all members wore hygiene gloves, masks and protective clothing ... hands and shoes were disinfected at every transition,\u201d the agency said in a statement. \u201cNevertheless, in respect of international cooperation practices and recommendations from panda experts who say that nonprofessionals having close contact with the baby panda can cause misunderstandings, we decided to withhold the release of the related video.\u201d "

The seven-member band\u2019s global fan base reacted sympathetically after Big Hit Entertainment said in a statement issued at midnight on Sunday that BTS would take their first official break from recording and performing since they formed six years ago. Hundreds of thousands of fans \u2013 who refer to themselves as the \u201cBTS army\u201d \u2013 left messages of support on the band\u2019s Twitter account, which has 21.3 million followers. \u201cI love you very much and hope you enjoy your break to the fullest,\u201d one wrote. Another said: \u201cWe are going nowhere and will be here to welcome you back with fanfares!\u201d Some used the hashtags #RestWellBTS and #HappyVacationBTS.

Thank you.\u201d BTS \u2013 or Bangtan Sonyeondan, which translates as Bulletproof Boy Scouts \u2013 have gained a huge following in recent years, becoming the first K-pop group to top charts in the US and Britain and playing a string of sold-out shows in Los Angeles, Paris and London. Last year they became the first K-pop act to debut at the top of the Billboard Album chart with \u201cLove Yourself: Tear.\u201d The agency\u2019s statement did not say when the group would return to work, but they are scheduled to perform in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia \u2013 to the anger of women\u2019s and LGBT rights campaigners \u2013 and Seoul in October. BTS\u2019s phenomenal global popularity has been a bright spot in an otherwise difficult year for K-pop, with several musicians implicated in allegations of sexual misconduct. BTS are worth more than $3.5bn annually to South Korea\u2019s economy, according to the Hyundai Research Institute, and the band was the reason why one in every 13 foreign tourists visited the country in 2017.

            "title": "'I was stupid': K-pop scandal engulfs third star who admits watching secret sex video",
            "content": "The scandal within the K-pop industry has widened, with a third high-profile star quitting his band after admitting to viewing a secretly filmed sex video. Yong Jun-hyung, 29, announced on Thursday that he would leave the boy band Highlight after he recanted his previous denials of receiving such videos. Yong said he had received a clip that another entertainer had recorded without the woman\u2019s consent and then participated in \u201cinappropriate conversations\u201d about it. \u201cAll these behaviours were extremely unethical, and I was stupid,\u201d he said in a message to his 1.7 million followers on Instagram.  \u201cI\u2019ll leave Highlight since I realised the seriousness of the issue and don\u2019t want it to bring further damage to my fans,\u201d he added, according to a translation by South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency. Highlight\u2019s entertainment label, Around US Entertainment, said in a statement that Yong was \u201cnow in a deep state of reflection for his past inappropriate actions, as well as for the disappointment that he undoubtedly caused many due to his immorality\u201d. The admission emerged on the same day that South Korean police were set to question two other K-pop stars over their roles in the scandal. They include singer-songwriter and television personality Jung Joon-young, 30, who is at the centre of the filming allegations. Jung has already admitted to secretly filming women having sex with him and then sharing the video in a chat group that included other entertainers. Jung, who cut short a trip to the US and quit showbusiness earlier this week, arrived at the the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency for questioning on Thursday morning. \u201cI am very sorry to the public for causing concern,\u201d Jung said as he entered the police station. \u201cI will faithfully undergo investigation.\u201d Local media have reported that another industry figure who received the videos was Bigbang member Seungri, 29, who quit on Monday amid separate allegations that he procured prostitutes for business partners in return for investments.  Seungri \u2013 who has pledged to clear his name \u2013 was due to face police questioning later on Thursday. The scandals have rocked K-pop, which has a global fan base and generates billions of dollars for the South Korean economy. Within broader South Korean society, the use of hidden cameras to record sexually explicit material, known as molka, is a fast-growing problem. Police figures indicate the number of molka arrests rose from 1,110 in 2010 to more than 6,600 in 2014. The revelations caused outrage within the country, with an association of female lawyers arguing the scandals give an insight into the widespread problem of women being treated as objects of sexual gratification and not as human beings. Lee Suh-yoon, a writer for the The Korea Times, a daily newspaper, also suggested that \u201cthese recurring outbursts of gender-related crimes can no longer be attributed to ethical lapses of a few select individuals, meaning it\u2019s time to point the finger at society, culture and an industry that overlooks and encourages such horrifying behaviour\u201d.

            "title": "K-boom! How the unstoppable stars of K-pop went gunning for the art world",
            "content": "Ohnim is having a blue period, just like Picasso. Over Zoom from a gallery in Seoul, the Korean rapper Song Min-ho, better known as Mino to K-pop fans but Ohnim in the art world, shows me a painting he finished the previous evening in collaboration with artist Choi Na-ri. It depicts a blue crouched figure, like a depressed version of Rodin\u2019s Thinker. It may be still wet but will soon be shipped to London\u2019s Saatchi Gallery for an art fair that showcases work by three of Korea\u2019s biggest K-pop stars. The meeting of K-pop and K-art is making the art world lick its lips. Businessman David Ciclitira, who set up the StART Art Fair at the Saatchi, says: \u201cK-pop stars have immense reach through their social media. Guys like Mino, Henry Lau and Kang Seung-yoon, whose work will be in the show, have six to seven million followers each on Instagram. In Seoul, fans queue round the block just to see a work of art by any of them. Then they fight each other to buy. I don\u2019t suppose it\u2019ll be quite like that at the Saatchi Gallery, but you never know.\u201d Ohnim and Kang Seung-yoon, both members of K-pop band Winner, and Canadian-born Henry Lau, former member of Super Junior-M, are effectively multimedia brands, combining singing, acting, making art, fashion, reality TV \u2026 and plugging products. Ohnim, for instance, endorses a German lip balm and did his first art show in collaboration with a Korean eyewear brand. He also modelled for Louis Vuitton. Stars such as Ohnim are part of what\u2019s known as hallyu, or the \u201cKorean wave\u201d in culture, embracing K-pop, K-cinema (Oscar-winning Parasite), K-TV (Netflix\u2019s Squid Game), K-tech (Samsung) and even K-philosophy. Next year, Frieze will launch a Seoul fair, while London\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum will showcase the popular culture of South Korea in an exhibition. And then there is the K-art diaspora, with artists such as Bath Spa University academic Young In Hong, and Korean-born American conceptual artist Anicka Yi, whose commission at Tate Modern\u2019s Turbine Hall opened this week. Successive South Korean governments have tried to ride the Korean wave, pursuing a strategy of exporting pop culture worldwide following the Asian financial crash in the late 1990s. \u201cHallyu has been a deliberate tool of soft power,\u201d argues journalist Christine Ro. \u201cMany countries invest in cultural councils and exchanges partly to strengthen diplomatic aims. But the South Korean government\u2019s push for cultural power has had remarkably quick success.\u201d There is even a crossover between K-pop and K-politics. BTS, the boyband whose collaboration with Coldplay is currently No 1 in the US, were made Special Presidential Envoys for Future Generations and Culture by South Korea\u2019s president Moon Jae-In last month. They performed a prerecorded set at the UN, and made a speech praising the younger generation\u2019s resilience during the pandemic and urging sustainable development. As I chat to Ohnim, I notice in the corner of his painting his signature motif of a happy-looking girl. \u201cThe picture is inspired by the coronavirus pandemic,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are depressed, and that\u2019s what the blue figure represents. But the background and the little girl say something different. They say: \u2018It\u2019s OK. There will be happiness.\u2019 I try to be a good influencer, you see.\u201d This is a surprisingly upbeat message for the 28-year-old, whose public battles with his mental health have endeared him to his South Korean fanbase. Three years ago, at the height of his fame with Winner, Ohnim disclosed he had been diagnosed with panic disorder. \u201cMany things piled on and it happened,\u201d he said at the time. \u201cI always need to show a good appearance to the public and always shine, but there are a lot of things I need to deal with.\u201d Making art has helped him. He told his Instagram followers: \u201cIn this day and age I feel that language itself cannot function in its right form. I wanted to create another type of communication, where the remnants of our feelings that are buried and hidden away can be conveyed through simple and distorted shapes. The inability to have real interpersonal relationships and human touch in the world we currently live in has made me realise that I am unable to escape feelings of emptiness and hollowness.\u201d Art, he says, is proving better than three-minute K-pop songs at allowing him to explore not just his own mental health issues but to reflect on a world gone hideously wrong. In 2018, Ohnim collaborated on an eerie immersive installation called Burning Planet. Visitors to the space in Seoul\u2019s Seongsu-dong district walked down a long dark tunnel to a room where an old man explained that he was a gatekeeper to the Burning Planet, a world located at the edge of our solar system. Guests then proceeded through a door into a speakeasy where a giant robotic ostrich explained that on the Burning Planet, all organic life is extinct except for humans and ostriches. And then, curiously, guests were invited to eat a dessert made from ostrich eggs, before entering another space depicting human life on this planet. Feeble light installations symbolised scarce solar energy, while performers performed a dull ballet of repetitive movements. Like the Planet of the Apes, the Burning Planet was really an allegory of our own. \u201cSo many of us are burned out in a world that we\u2019re destroying,\u201d he explained. As Onim sips his drink, from 5,500 miles away, I study the tattoos that ring his throat. They are little circles of weather icons \u2013 cloudy, sunny and so on. \u201cI colour one in red to show what mood I\u2019m in.\u201d But none are ringed today? He shrugs, possibly because he doesn\u2019t know which mood he is in. Onim\u2019s art expresses something the philosopher Byung-Chul Han takes as symptomatic of contemporary South Korea. In his new book, Capitalism and the Death Drive, Han notes that his homeland has the highest suicide rate in the world. In part, he argues, this is because of the IMF bailout that followed the Asian financial crisis. Like Greece, South Korea was, he claims, forcibly subjected to \u201cradical reprogramming\u201d \u2013 what Naomi Klein called the \u201cshock doctrine\u201d. \u201cIn South Korea, there is no longer any real resistance to these measures,\u201d Han writes. \u201cInstead, one finds high levels of conformism and consensus \u2013 together with depression and burnout. Instead of seeking to change society, people use violence against themselves. The outward aggression that might have provided the basis for revolution has instead given way to auto-aggression.\u201d Evidence for this diagnosis was clear in last year\u2019s Korean Eye show at the Saatchi Gallery. One piece consisted of an A4 sheet of paper attached to a wall at its lower corners, one side bearing the image of a face drawn with a marker. Artist Kwantaeck Park arranged a fan to make the sheet rise up and down as if the face was bowing endlessly. Eunha Kim made a sculpture called Bon Appetit that looked like a hamburger but was made from discarded clothes. Lee Seung Koo installed a sculpture called Compromise Between Me and Me that looked like a dystopian Jeff Koons inflatable, with a huge gun firing gas-filled balloons shaped like hearts and oversized blood corpuscles across the gallery. The show\u2019s curator, Dimitri Ozerkov, of St Petersburg\u2019s State Hermitage Museum, wrote in his catalogue essay that Han was right in his diagnosis: auto-aggression bleeds into contemporary Korean culture and burnout; personality disorders and attention deficit hyperactivity are behind the nation\u2019s creative fecundity. \u201cThis new societal condition may be characterised in terms of narcissism taken to the point of religious fervour.\u201d K-art, then, is in a vexed position, both presenting Korea to the world, and at the same acting as a grenade that, as Ozekov puts it, \u201ccould blow the well-managed collective identity sky-high.\u201d Korean art was terra incognita for westerners (the late Nam June Paik notwithstanding) until David Ciclitira, the chairman of Parallel Media and co-founder of Sky TV, began collecting with his wife Serenella around 15 years ago. Impressed with what they saw in Seoul\u2019s galleries, they set up a programme called Global Eye aimed at developing the county\u2019s arts infrastructure, and arranged shows to promote the arts of Asian countries from Vietnam to Indonesia.  In 2012, Ciclitira set up Live Company, an events business that toured K-pop concerts to Asia and, eventually, Europe. Since then, his business interests have combined K-pop and K-art. On the wall behind him as we talk is the most striking Zoom backdrop I\u2019ve encountered during the pandemic, namely a 3.2m x 2m embroidery called Procession by Young In Hong. \u201cIt was the first large embroidery piece I did,\u201d she tells me from her Bristol studio.  She made Procession in 2010, a decade before her adoptive city bore witness to the toppling of slave trader Edward Colston\u2019s statue. But Procession is a work no less political. From the English west country, Young In Hong keeps a Korean eye on her homeland, meditating on its history and struggles. Visitors to London\u2019s Royal Academy may remember, in 2017, a group of Koreans lying in the courtyard. This was Young In Hong\u2019s performance piece 5100: Pentagon, memorialising students who were fired on, killed, raped and beaten by government troops in 1980\u2019s Gwangju protests against martial law. \u201cThe performance commemorates a specific event but is also a means of acting out a certain resistance toward prevailing social norms,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m quite a sensitive person to what\u2019s going on around me. Probably that\u2019s one of the reasons I came here, to get a sense of perspective on my homeland.\u201d Young In Hong\u2019s latest project is a 15-metre long text piece installed last month at the disused Jejin station in the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea. \u201cI picked this sentence from a book in which a woman is explaining to a lawyer why she wants to get a divorce. It reads: \u201cOur rhythms have been out of sync in the past.\u201d Young In Hong repurposes the text to comment on other things out of sync: North and South Korea, train timetables, men and women, humans and their mental health. Emblazoned in huge type over the entrance to the disused station, it is hardly an example of soft power or a lucrative investment opportunity for collectors, but it is certainly part of the K-art wave breaking both at home and abroad. StART Art Fair is at Saatchi Gallery, London, 13-17 October "

            "title": "50 great tracks for August from Taylor Swift, Kano, Jenny Hval and more",
            "content": "Back in February, Taylor Swift wrote for Elle about the importance of specificity in pop songs: \u201cWe like being confided in and hearing someone say, \u2018This is what I went through\u2019 as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles,\u201d she declared. Strangely, then, the first songs from her forthcoming seventh album Lover didn\u2019t really do that \u2013 ME! and You Need to Calm Down had anthemic, outward-facing intentions, celebrating weirdness and telling bigots to wind it in. But The Archer does: looking deeply inwards, it might be the most personal and self-lacerating song Swift has ever released. She sounds wearied by her self-professed immaturity (\u201cI never grew up / It\u2019s getting so old\u201d) and self-defeatist tendencies (\u201cI cut off my nose just to spite my face / Then I hate my reflection for years and years\u201d), conflicted by her roles as predator and victim. It\u2019s not a proper single \u2013 there\u2019s no headline-grabbing video \u2013 and the production is low-key, just a blooming Chromatics-y synth glow that builds but never breaks, so it\u2019s had a quieter reception than Lover\u2019s first two singles. But it\u2019s a small, sincere marvel. LS Kano was one of the great breakthroughs of grime\u2019s first wave with tracks like P\u2019s and Q\u2019s, and showed major ambition with albums that also straddled R&B, jungle and hip-hop. Like fellow originators Skepta and Wiley, he too had a fallow period \u2013 2010 flop Method to the Madnesss \u2013 before hurtling back with renewed vigour, for 2016\u2019s Made in the Manor, his best album yet. A pair of new tracks suggest the follow-up could be even better. A little like Strangers from his previous album, Trouble uses piano and sparse drums, giving Kano space to plead for an end to cyclical gang violence. \u201cYou ever seen a mother\u2019s tears run down Gucci glasses?\u201d, he asks, criticising both the violence itself and the peacocking consumerism that partly powers it in a single line. But he encourages rather than scolds, and gives short shrift to politicians who would do the latter: \u201cThese gunshots never reach your town\u201d. The result is a moving, charismatic UK twist on the gospel rap of Kanye West and Chance the Rapper. BBT There\u2019s a great tradition of meta songs, the kind where musicians sing about an imagined song that becomes real through their writing. Norwegian pop experimentalist Jenny Hval is great at this sort of conceptual summoning \u2013 and somehow, in Ashes to Ashes, she doesn\u2019t just make a dreamed song real, but turns it into a chilling meditation on mortality and the fragile boundaries between permanence and transience. A friend dreams about burying someone\u2019s ashes then having a cigarette; Hval dreams about digging her own grave and it being like playing an instrument; about sexual fantasy as a form of suffocation. That would all be hard work if not for how light Ashes to Ashes is, a pulsing, clubbing pop gem that, like her theme, seems to hover between reality and reverie. LS The production of Charli XCX and Christine and the Queens\u2019 killer collaboration \u2013 courtesy of PC Music\u2019s AG Cook, and someone called \u00d6 \u2013 sounds like fists battering against a locked door, a frenzied plea for escape. Both Charli and Chris have talked about battling the closed-minded limitations of the industry; by coming together, they liberate each other and push pop further into the future. In Gone, they reject an indifferent, fickle scene (\u201cpour me one more / watch the ice melt in my fist\u201d might be Charli\u2019s best lyric yet) and then forge their own private language. What does it mean to \u201ckeep when the water runs\u201d? I don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s the kind of idiosyncratic linguistic quirk that pop magic is made from. That \u201ckeep\u201d repeats and fragments through the rest of the song, a battering ram of persistence and self-possession that drives their liberation home (a feat made clearer in the superb video, where Chris frees Charli from bondage and they have a majestic dance-off on top of a car in the rain). LS This startlingly beautiful 10-piece K-pop boyband is actually one of four subsets of an overall 21-member group, NCT, and while it\u2019s easy to be cynical about the reasoning underpinning this setup \u2013 four lots of merch to flog to obsessive fans! \u2013 it\u2019s much harder to resist the charms of new single Highway to Heaven. The English-language lyrics rather make you long for Korean, particularly the rapping (\u201cSkrrt, pull up in the coupe, beep-beep\u201d), but the spectacular chorus and soft-rock verses make this a kind of Boys of Summer 2019. Also of note in K-pop this month is Baekhyun, whose versatile voice winds jazzily through the snapping rap production on mini-album City Lights. BBT Sam Smith and Max Martin bounce back from the precipice of irrelevance with this sublime \u201cI\u2019m not angry, just disappointed\u201d club heartbreaker, all trap beats and dramatic bassy slurs. Smith\u2019s lover is a liar who\u2019s making him crazy. He swears he\u2019ll leave, no longer able to recognise himself, but not entirely cheated of his optimism: \u201cI\u2019m hoping that my love will keep you up tonight,\u201d he says, clinging on to the promise that there\u2019s nobility in devotion. Critics have whispered about Sam Smith in the same breath as George Michael before, but this sophisticated, assured comeback is the first time he\u2019s truly lived up to the comparison. LS The standout from the latest Africa Express sessions in Johannesburg pairs Yeah Yeah Yeahs guitarist Nick Zinner with Ugandan electro acholi star Otim Alpha, London producer Georgia and South African vocal harmony group Mahotella Queens. Georgia takes the vocal lead, singing with sweet determination about Hilda Tloubatla leaving her township to join the Mahotella Queens in 1960s Johannesburg, the city hustle and bustle reflected in Alpha\u2019s darkly glittering, pumping production. LS Anchored by a remarkable drummer, this seven-piece British post-punk band may only have released one song so far but are playing the kind of thrilling gigs it takes others months of touring to work up to. Their second release, the nine-minute Sunglasses, sets out their stall: skronky brass and a Tortoise-ish groove shift up a gear to hurtle into a wildly strident climax. Throughout, vocalist Isaac Wood has a series of vivid visions: a confrontation with privilege and conservatism brought on by his mum juicing watermelons in a Nutribullet; feeling invincible behind a pair of sunglasses on a crowded street; a lover telling him to \u201cfuck me like you mean it\u201d and screaming at him: \u201cLeave Kanye out of this!\u201d Funny, vivid and anthemic. BBT One of the richest troves in the reissues market in recent years has been gospel music made in the middle of the 20th century. Numero Group\u2019s exceptional three-part Good God! series, Honest Jon\u2019s compilation Christians Catch Hell, Mississippi Records\u2019 Life is a Problem and many others have excavated songs that burn with Christian fervour, the artists\u2019 faith giving their music a certain keen feeling that secular music can never match. Next up is Luaka Bop\u2019s The Time For Peace Is Now, released on 13 September, and this track from it is a truly valuable find: a lo-fi but full-bodied soul backing lifts the tearjerkingly beautiful chorus to the heavens. BBT The church organ has become an instrument of endless fascination to a set of young, primarily female composers: Kara-Lis Coverdale, Ellen Arkbro, Sarah Davachi, Anna Von Hausswolff and others have all built their work around its stately ambient chords. Stockholm-based US composer Kali Malone has worked with all kinds of digital and analogue drones in the past but for new album The Sacrificial Code she solely uses a church organ, closely miked so as to remove any sense of the building it\u2019s in, and \u201cstripped of gestural adornments and spontaneous expressive impulse\u201d. She uses this austerity to achieve transcendence, zooming into sound at an almost microscopic level: on Rose Wreath Crown (For CW) you can feel the waves of bass vibrating off each other. Her minimalist approach also means that when an emotive chord change arrives, it\u2019s all the more gut-punching. BBT "

            "title": "English is no longer the default language of American pop",
            "content": "The biggest K-pop band in the world inch towards being the biggest global pop act full stop \u2013 the video for this latest single was played 45m times on YouTube in the first 24 hours of release, which is a new record. And with good reason: it is an absolute juggernaut, with a terrace chant chorus, Eurovision-level saxophone, and a surprisingly welcome return for Nicki Minaj to pop-dance beats. The group are folding ever more English language into their tracks as their star rises in the west, resulting in a dizzying bilingual hybrid. Quite simply the best track yet from Empress Of, AKA LA singer-songwriter-producer Lorely Rodriguez. Her 2015 debut album was head-turning for its sensual, impulsive pop smarts, but not all the choruses totally connected. No such problem here \u2013 the central melody is riveting: feathery and near-falsetto, it drops into a heartwrenching final line as as Rodriguez laments her disconnection from the man she\u2019s with. Shades of Jessie Ware and her regular collaborator Dev Hynes, perhaps, but outshining both with a song that already feels classic. He has never truly broken into the mainstream, seen sometimes as a mere curio or clotheshorse, but Theophilus London is a valuable MC, announcing earlier than most that rap should think bigger when it comes to genre boundaries. Everyone from Tegan and Sara\u2019s Sara Quinn and Leon Ware to Kanye West have appeared on his tracks; now he recruits Giggs for a remix of his track Bebey. The bright, funky, loping beat draws out the puckish side of his London guest, his phone blowing up as he announces his greatness and does a spot of shopping on Bond Street. Marie Davidson\u2019s voice is one of the biggest pleasures in contemporary electronic music. French-accented, often drily amused and given to rants, declarations and snatches of internal monologue, she continues the grand style of talky electro on from the likes of Miss Kittin. On So Right, the first track from forthcoming album Working Class Woman, a quiet side-of-the-dancefloor reverie (\u201cHe\u2019s got me feeling so high / man this is so nice\u201d) builds into a full house diva performance, over a classic Chicago bassline. The result is a track that essays the body high of club music and shows how close that feeling is to the erotic. It\u2019s gloriously populist, but still retains Davidson\u2019s indelible stamp; expect to hear this everywhere. A new supergroup that is quite formidable in its collective angst: Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus are all experts at emotional torpor, articulated with pin-drop clarity amid moping guitars, but thankfully don\u2019t cancel each other out when they come together. Three tracks from their forthcoming EP have been released, all excellent. Stay Down is simultaneously the most morose and the most uplifting, Baker taking the lead vocal for a song of compromised romance that builds to a stunning arena-indie climax. Downbeat, understated R&B might look easy on paper \u2013 smoky vocal, minimalist drums, job done \u2013 but the patchiness of, say, the Jorja Smith album shows how tough it is to pull off. Kenzie, a Bostonian singer-songwriter now living in London, is managing it, though, with her debut tracks. Over Dark July\u2019s softly pattering breakbeat, she sings a beautiful, fragmentary summer love story with perfect huskiness, speeding from meet-cute to crying breakup in the space of a chorus. Its nagging melody is deceptively simple, but will set up shop in your brain if you\u2019re not careful. You can take comfort, in this mixed-up world, from the fact that every year there\u2019ll be a new Kurt Vile record: it won\u2019t be very different from the last, and it\u2019ll be great. On this one there is the usual bold and beautiful Neil Young-ish strumming, the glittering yet unshowy solos, and the drily amused slacker vocals. \u201cHow beautiful to take a bite out of the world,\u201d Vile muses as he kicks around his home town on the way to a long psychedelic outro. Beautiful and beguiling bedroom pop here, from rising London-based producer Jess Bartlet. The other two tracks from her Comrade EP flirt with a 4/4 techno pulse, but the title track has sweet and subtle syncopation under a glittering curtain of multitracked harp. It could have been twee in its sheer prettiness, but the jazzy sax and trumpet solos keep it cutely idiosyncratic, and Bartlet\u2019s vocal in the chorus \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll be there when you need me\u201d \u2013 is powerful in its calm certainty. Love blokes screaming their larynxes out in near-unintelligible roars but can\u2019t get on board with the double kick-drums of straight metal nor the pomposity of the doom scene? Thou are your new favourite band. Despite being from Louisiana they dress like a group of Transylvanian vampires going to a cabaret evening, and have a great interplay between giant doom chords, stirring melodic progressions, and quite splashy, punkish drums. Elimination Rhetoric has the added bonus of an uplifting bit of soloing, segueing into a passage of joyous headbanging. \u201cI can\u2019t help myself, don\u2019t talk to me!\u201d Bryan Funck declares through his apparently rotted throat. One of the year\u2019s best and creepiest 12ins has been released: Don\u2019t DJ\u2019s All Love Affairs Fail But They Never End, a dub-techno epic that kicks off with Veles. Created by Berliner Florian Meyer, it has a tiny whisper of his earlier work with \u201cexotic\u201d sounds such as marimbas and flutes, in the subtle pan-pipe pattern on the offbeat. But that is met with absolute menace in the form of what sounds like a detuned, timestretched monastic chant. Its restless beat never quite finds its footing, and what is that scurrying and creaking at the back of the mix? This is a whole universe of glorious disquiet. When Jin from the superstar boyband BTS released Super Tuna \u2013 an upbeat song about his favourite pastime, fishing \u2013 it instantly went viral. The track, written to commemorate the star\u2019s birthday, has logged more than 53m YouTube views since December, and on TikTok the #SuperTuna hashtag has inspired a viral dance challenge. With the popularity of groups such as BTS and the girl group Blackpink, which have international fanbases that number in the tens of millions, K-pop dominates pop culture far beyond its South Korean homeland. As the significance of the industry intensifies, so too does the importance of the teams that power K-pop \u2013 the creators behind every act responsible for music, fashion, choreography and more. Bumzu is among them. The 30-year-old solo artist turned songwriter-producer, who co-produced Super Tuna, has emerged as one of the industry\u2019s most influential people in K-pop. Seventeen, his biggest act, has sold more than 10m albums in South Korea and had four No 1 hits on Billboard\u2019s World Albums chart. Bumzu has also worked on tracks for other big names including Nu\u2019est, Shinee, Rain and 2PM. \u201cFrankly, I feel a lot of pressure. There are many times when that pressure gnaws away at me. But it\u2019s also true that this feeling drives me to become stronger again,\u201d said Bumzu, whose real name is Kye Beom-joo. K-pop forms part of a multibillion-dollar industry that has become one of South Korea\u2019s most valuable cultural products, with the country\u2019s content industry exporting a record $11.92bn in 2020. The popularity of K-pop continues to grow amid the rise of the Korean Wave, which also includes film, TV, food and beauty. On top of being a cultural phenomenon, it has also emerged as an important source of political soft power for South Korea \u2013 and one of fanbased activism in support of causes ranging from climate action to human rights. Yet even Bumzu struggles to pinpoint the reasons for K-pop\u2019s global appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking why barbecue is so delicious and being told it\u2019s because there\u2019s meat,\u201d Bumzu jokes. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can define K-pop by just a few factors. We just make music that moves the heart.\u201d Bumzu grew up in Seoul, surrounded by music. A talented child violinist, he was already thinking up tunes and lyrics in his head at the age of five. His older brother was passionate about music and filled the house with equipment, which left a lasting impression on Bumzu. He wasn\u2019t allowed to touch anything for fear he would break it, so he began working part-time jobs and saving money to buy his own equipment. He explored music production using computer software, not too far removed from the techniques he uses today. Bumzu was fascinated with visual kei \u2013 a mixture of glam rock, metal and punk popular in Japan since the 80s. Later he fell in love with hip-hop, making beats and singing over them, and also R&B, listening to Boyz II Men and Brian McKnight on a loop. By high school, he was determined to become a musician. In Seoul\u2019s hip university district of Hongdae, he became active in the underground music scene. \u201cAt the time, we called it underground. Most of the people who made music there are now creating what the public calls K-hip-hop. It\u2019s no longer underground,\u201d he says. Bumzu\u2019s career as a singer took off after competing in the television talent show Superstar K in 2012. Despite not making it to the end, he gained popularity and released his first EP a year later. He joined Pledis Entertainment \u2013 an agency recently acquired by the parent company of Big Hit Music, which is behind BTS \u2013 and began working as a vocal coach for a group of young trainees who later became Seventeen. Bumzu was responsible for Seventeen\u2019s first hit, Adore U, about a teenage boy\u2019s innocent love confession. \u201cAs I composed the song, I thought that this would be the perfect debut single for a group,\u201d Bumzu says. \u201cIt helped me develop and refine my style.\u201d Most of Bumzu\u2019s day is spent writing songs for artists, working in the studio and attending meetings. There are few breaks. He is constantly interacting with other producers, artists and label representatives. \u201cWe live in an era of collaboration and open communication, and nobody can accomplish everything or shine alone. I have a team to strengthen my expertise, and I always consult professionals in other areas,\u201d he says. One of the most important parts of Bumzu\u2019s job is to give each act a unique sound. \u201cEvery band, every artist, has their own style, direction or goal,\u201d he says. \u201cThe most important topic we worry about every day is the unique flair, the colour of this artist, this team.\u201d With Seventeen, Bumzu works closest with band member, close friend and gym buddy Woozi, who co-writes and co-produces many of the group\u2019s discography. \u201cHe\u2019s a very talented artist and songwriter,\u201d Bumzu says. \u201cWe share ideas, discuss a lot and complement each other\u2019s techniques. \u201cI once asked Seventeen member Hoshi to think of the choreography first. We then worked on the rhythm from it and then the melody after that. I don\u2019t have a fixed order.\u201d Bumzu says the composition of a song starts and ends with inspiration, which can come from anything. \u201cThere are times when I make track ideas and melodies in my head while holding dumbbells at the gym,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in the same boat with the singers I produce for. We know that teamwork is important and everyone tries to go in one direction. If I row the opposite way, we can\u2019t sail where we want to go. Even a small paddle can have a big impact.\u201d For the first time ever, the No 1 album in America features lyrics sung mostly in Korean. Love Yourself: Tear by K-pop group BTS has been in a fierce chart battle with Post Malone this week, but has managed to clinch the No 1 spot, outperforming industry predictions. The record\u2019s success comes at a time of huge opportunity in the US music industry for acts that don\u2019t perform in English. In the 16 years between the summer of the Macarena in 1996 and the viral success of Psy\u2019s Gangnam Style in 2012, there wasn\u2019t a single song performed in a language other than English to hit the top 10 of the Billboard Hot 100. In the past three years though, the proportion of non-English tracks on Billboard has been increasing. This has, in large part, been down to the success of reggaeton artists and, in particular, Despacito, the Daddy Yankee and Luis Fonsi hit that had a 16-week record-breaking reign at No 1 last summer. Despacito opened the door for other latin tracks. In 2016, the year before its release, there were just four Spanish-language tracks in the top 100 all year. In 2017, there were 19. The number is almost certainly set to rise this year. This week\u2019s Billboard 100 features six non-English songs including Fake Love by BTS \u2013 sung in Korean \u2013 and Te Bote, Dura, X and Dame Tu Cosita \u2013 reggaeton tracks all performed in Spanish. After the success of Despacito, Luis Fonsi had said he was sent videos from all over the world of \u201cpeople trying to nail the Spanish, trying to learn a bit of Spanish through the song\u201d. Spanish has long been the most commonly learned language in the US, but the influence of K-pop is being felt in the languages young Americans are learning. Between 2013 and 2016, as K-pop grew dramatically in popularity in America, US college enrolments in Korean classes went up 65%, even as overall enrolments in foreign language courses dropped off. Priscilla Kim is the director of the Korean Cultural Center in New York, which offers language courses. She says that, among younger students, K-pop has become a driving factor to learn the language. \u201cOver the years we have definitely witnessed growing popularity of K-pop among younger students. As a Korean language and cultural institution located in the heart of K-town, we have courses in the summer that are tailored toward K-pop fans who are interested in learning Korean through K-pop lyrics.\u201d The language app Duolingo launched a Korean course in September 2017 and it currently has 2.78 million total learners. On message boards on the site, users have talked about being inspired by K-pop acts as well as Korean TV to learn Korean, and the app has included some lessons that are based around K-pop. The vast majority of songs and albums streamed in the US are still performed in English, but the rapid chart surge for non-English music in the past few years suggests this may just be the beginning.  At a time where some Americans are concerned that speaking other languages in public puts themselves in danger, pop music feels like a progressive antidote, with the importance of what language a song is performed in second to the music itself.

            "title": "BTS: Love Yourself: Tear review \u2013 K-pop's biggest band keep ploughing on",
            "content": "In January, the BBC News website ran a story about a 23-year-old called Stephanie Fairfield, who had uprooted her life in Scotland and moved 5,000 miles to Seoul in order to be closer to the K-pop boyband BTS. It was news that seemed to startle even BTS\u2019s seven members, presumably no strangers to the attentions of obsessive fans: in South Korea, they\u2019re so popular that their fan club apparently has a waiting list, prospective members being required to buy a certain amount of merchandise before they\u2019re allowed to join.  Western audiences are traditionally resistant to K-pop, with its lyrics in Korean and Japanese, and its customs as mysterious as some of BTS\u2019s translated song titles: Blanket Kick, Spine Breaker, Dimple and the thought-provoking War of Hormone. Moreover, the traditional reaction of western media to K-pop has been to recoil, muttering that there\u2019s something faintly creepy about it: its antiseptic cuteness, the battery farming of young performers tied to \u201cslave\u201d contracts, with everything from their diets to their sex lives strictly controlled by companies so ruthlessly exploitative of artists and fans alike they make Simon Cowell\u2019s Syco corporation look like Crass\u2019s anarchist commune in Epping Forest. Not any more: Fairfield was an admittedly extreme example of how BTS have quietly broken into the affections of British and American fans. Their last album went gold in the US \u2013 unprecedented for a K-pop band \u2013 while their next London shows involve two nights at the 20,000-capacity O2 Arena, which everyone expects to sell out, even with the cheapest tickets at \u00a362 a pop. Europe\u2019s biggest venue will be packed with fans singing along phonetically to songs in a language they largely don\u2019t understand.  The question of how this has happened is easily answered. No other genre has so successfully harnessed the power of fans on social media to spread the word. BTS were the most tweeted-about celebrities in 2017. No aspect of their career is too minor for fans to vlog about: on YouTube, there are people posting reaction videos to the fact that BTS changed their logo. In the US, meanwhile, K-pop fans have repeatedly used their own money to take out adverts for artists on the electronic billboards in New York\u2019s Times Square, at a cost of $30,000 a go, which sounds less like something that would happen in real life than a particularly lurid dream had by a venal record company boss. The question of why is more complex. The reasons traditionally given for BTS\u2019s success back home \u2013 their lyrics are, by K-pop\u2019s germ-free standards, pretty raffish and controversial \u2013 don\u2019t hold here: you can\u2019t imagine British teenagers are that desperate to hear youthful criticism of societal conventions in South Korea. So theories abound, ranging from the prosaic \u2013 they\u2019re filling a vacuum in the market created by One Direction\u2019s split \u2013 to the philosophical: if boyband fandom is all about projecting your fantasies on to the performers, then perhaps a group whose lyrics you don\u2019t understand represent an appealingly blank screen. Listening to BTS\u2019s new album \u2013 43 minutes of music available in five different CD editions, each priced between \u00a320 and \u00a325 \u2013 you do wonder how much it has to do with the music. At least part of K-pop\u2019s appeal is that it seems different to British or American manufactured pop. It\u2019s hard to imagine a UK boyband looking like BTS, with their hair styled in matching bushy bowl cuts and dyed neon colours, and it\u2019s hard to think of a western act that dances with the weirdly thrilling, millimetre-perfect synchronicity favoured by K-pop choreographers. There are conventions and customs surrounding K-pop that seem very alien to western pop, from the special attention focused on the maknae, or youngest member of each band, to the bags of rice fans are encouraged to collect for charity. But there\u2019s nothing about Love Yourself: Tear that sounds particularly alien to British ears, beyond the fact that they\u2019re singing in Korean, with the odd English phrase thrown in: \u201cI still want you\u201d; \u201cSo show me, I\u2019ll show you\u201d. It leans a little more heavily on rapping than a western boyband would perhaps dare, but otherwise, with its autotuned vocals, its big EDM synths on Magic Shop and its appropriation of the post-Despacito trend for Latin-flavoured pop on Airplane Pt 2 (\u201cWe\u2019re going from Mexico City to Paris!\u201d they sing. \u201cMariachi! Mariachi! Mariachi!\u201d), it sounds almost exactly like a mainstream British pop album would, with all the good and bad that entails. On the plus side, they\u2019re very good at ballads, performing them with a breathy intensity that\u2019s genuinely affecting and powerful. There are some very well-turned songs here, not least So What, which offers a pretty flavoursome brand of bubblegum pop house: fizzy synthesizers, a hook that pounds its way into your brain. And there are also some lovely, intriguing production touches: the jazzy guitar and flute that snakes around 134340; the ghostly, reverb-drenched opening to Outro: Tear; the canny way Intro: Singularity, probably the best song here and blessed with a particularly haunting tune, pitches its sound somewhere between vintage 70s soul and a latter-day R&B slow jam. But there is also stuff that you struggle to recall the second it finishes: in one ear and out the other it goes, leaving no recognisable trace. It\u2019s not that it\u2019s overly saccharine, which is the charge regularly levelled at K-pop; it\u2019s just commonplace. Ampanman and Paradise are the kind of ho-hum pop-R&B tracks with which albums are padded out the world over.  So the phenomenon of BTS seems more interesting than the music at its centre, although Love Yourself: Tear is certainly good enough to keep the phenomenon moving smoothly. Indeed, the phenomenon is currently moving at such a pace, it feels pretty redundant reviewing it: a month before it was released, Love Yourself: Tear had already amassed advanced orders of 1.4m copies. The fans have already decided it\u2019s a masterpiece and a must-have. Its actual contents are almost beside the point.  "

            "title": "BTS review \u2013 charisma and confidence from the world\u2019s biggest pop group",
            "content": "A military court jailed the disgraced former K-pop star Seungri for three years on Thursday for arranging sex services and other charges stemming from a sex and gambling scandal, according to reports. The 30-year-old singer from the popular boyband Big Bang, who retired from showbusiness as the scandal mounted and later enlisted in the military, was found guilty on all nine counts against him, according to various media reports. Big Bang enjoyed widespread fame after their 2006 debut, and Seungri \u2013 real name Lee Seung-hyun \u2013 went on to become a successful businessman. He was convicted of arranging sex services for potential investors in his business, as well as overseas gambling at luxurious casinos in Las Vegas involving illicit foreign exchange transactions. \u201cIt is hard to see the defendant was not aware of financial payments paid to the women for sex,\u201d the judge, Hwang Min-je, was cited as saying. \u201cIt appears that he carried out systematic sexual prostitution.\u201d Seungri had changed his testimony under police questioning and in court, he added, and \u201clacked credibility\u201d. The singer was also ordered to pay 1.15bn won ($1m) in restitution. The investigation into the scandal surrounding him uncovered a spate of allegations against other musicians and personnel at YG Entertainment, Seungri\u2019s former agency and one of K-pop\u2019s biggest management firms. It prompted the agency\u2019s chief executive, Yang Hyun-suk, to step down, facing inquiries of his own into illicit gambling. Reaction to the verdict was swift on Thursday, with many users online saying Seungri\u2019s punishment was too light for the offences. \u201cWhile it is fortunate he is finally being jailed, the term is too short,\u201d a user on Naver, South Korea\u2019s largest portal, posted. Another said: \u201cIt should\u2019ve been 30 years, not three.\u201d The verdict came a month before he was due to be discharged from his mandatory military service. All able-bodied South Korean men are obliged to fulfil about two years of military service to defend the country from nuclear-armed North Korea, with which it remains technically at war. \u201cWe can\u2019t see you, but we\u2019re so glad you can see us,\u201d beams Jungkook, breathing heavily. BTS \u2013 the world\u2019s biggest pop group \u2013 have just opened their performance at Seoul\u2019s Olympic stadium in typically flat-out fashion. After flying through the elaborate choreography and ferocious passion of tracks On, Burning Up (Fire) and Dope \u2013 songs from three very different stages of the South Korean group\u2019s eight-year career, the seven members are taking a moment to speak frankly. Although their stadium show has flames, fireworks, dozens of balletic dancers dressed like swans and a live band complete with a choreographed brass section, RM, Jin, Suga, j-hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook are missing just one thing: the band\u2019s beloved fanbase, known as Army. Tonight\u2019s live-stream audience could have sold out the Olympic stadium 10 times over. Instead of dealing with pre-sales, touts and expensive hotels, fans can watch the performance from six perfectly framed camera angles, enjoy live translation, and congregate on social media: when BTS perform just a snippet of a beloved older song, Blood Sweat & Tears, some 50,000 ecstatic tweets are fired off immediately. Still, j-hope gestures at the stadium\u2019s 69,000 empty seats. \u201cIt makes me lonely,\u201d he admits. It\u2019s no small task to perform a stadium-sized show, let alone without the energy and encouragement radiating from a sea of euphoric fans. Harder still when you have a band member out of action: after a small rehearsal injury, V sings with regal acceptance from an armchair, missing out on much of the group\u2019s high-powered delivery. Named Permission to Dance (On Stage) after the uplifting summer single of the same name, the concert spans their discography with unusually broad strokes. While BTS\u2019 epic album Map of the Soul: 7 would have underpinned last year\u2019s cancelled world tour, tonight feels closer to a greatest hits. They use dance breaks to segue between remixes of milestone singles, and in doing so uncover unexpected thematic links: Blue & Grey, a soft, devastating ballad created during the pandemic, bleeds beautifully into Black Swan, a darkly theatrical song about the fear of falling out of love with music. BTS have experimented with genre since their 2013 debut, but the way they use each member\u2019s strengths \u2013 RM\u2019s cool authority, Jin\u2019s silvery vibrato, Suga\u2019s fierce intensity, j-hope\u2019s colourful expressionism, Jimin\u2019s tender strength, V\u2019s dusky baritone and Jungkook\u2019s athletic adlibs \u2013 confirms their charisma and confidence as a group. It tethers them together through the old-school hip-hop inflections of tracks like Dis-ease and Baepsae, the EDM explosion of So What and heartbreaking closer Spring Day, a song fans refer to as the \u201cqueen\u201d for its beauty and grace. This group is so often described as a phenomenon: they\u2019ve broken long-held music industry records and smashed the assumption that pop should be in English for it to find global success. But to call them a phenomenon also implies that their star power is something of a mystery \u2013 and that is not true. To watch BTS perform \u2013 online, or offline \u2013 is to understand the tenacity, talent and passion that has fuelled them to these heights. "

            "title": "K-beauty, hallyu and mukbang: dozens of Korean words added to Oxford English Dictionary",
            "content": "The Korean culture wave has swept through the editorial offices of the Oxford English Dictionary (OED), which has added more than 20 new words of Korean origin to its latest edition. The \u201cdefinitive record of the English language\u201d included words alluding to the global popularity of the country\u2019s music and cuisine, plus one or two whose roots in the Korean language may be less obvious. The K- prefix is prominently featured, as you might expect given that so many people outside of South Korea now listen to K-pop \u2013 which was added to the OED in 2016 \u2013 watch K-dramas or use K-beauty products. The new words include hallyu - the Korean original for the wave of pop culture that has made BTS one of the world\u2019s most popular bands and Squid Game the Netflix sensation of 2021. \u201cThe increase in international interest in South Korea and its popular culture, esp. as represented by the global success of South Korean music, film, television, fashion, and food,\u201d the dictionary says in its definition. \u201cAlso: South Korean popular culture and entertainment itself. Frequently as a modifier, as in hallyu craze, hallyu fan, hallyu star.\u201d But as the dictionary\u2019s new additions make clear, there is much more to Korean cuisine than its spicy staple kimchi, which appeared in the OED as long ago as 1976. New food-related entries include bulgogi \u2013 thin slices of beef or pork \u2013 and chimaek \u2013 Korean-style fried chicken and beer. Traditional culture is represented by hanbok \u2013 formal attire worn by both men and women \u2013 and Hangul, the Korean alphabet devised by King Sejong in 1443. Aegyo, a certain kind of cuteness or charm considered characteristically Korean, and similar to the Japanese word kawaii, has been included as both a noun and adjective. There is room, too, for mukbang, or livestreams of people eating extraordinary amounts of food while talking to the online audience. The inclusion of \u201cskinship\u201d is more surprising. Commonly used in South Korea, where it is rendered as seukinsip, and Japan (sukinshippu) it captures the emotional bond that comes from close physical contact between a parent and child, lovers and friends, the dictionary said. The OED said the inclusion of so many Korean words was recognition of a shift in language usage beyond the English-speaking world. \u201cThe adoption and development of these Korean words in English also demonstrate how lexical innovation is no longer confined to the traditional centres of English in the United Kingdom and the United States,\u201d it said. \u201cThey show how Asians in different parts of the continent invent and exchange words within their own local contexts, then introduce these words to the rest of the English-speaking world, thus allowing the Korean wave to continue to ripple on the sea of English words.\u201d "

            "content": "The management company behind the popular South Korean boy band BTS has scored a huge hit on the country\u2019s stock market after its shares doubled on their first day of trading. Investors scrambled to buy into the success story of Big Hit Entertainment amid speculation that the South Korean government could allow K-pop and other celebrities to defer their military service, citing their huge contribution to the country\u2019s economy and international reputation. Big Hit Entertainment\u2019s shares started life on the Seoul market at 270,000 won ($US253), compared with an initial public offering price of 135,000 won last month. The stock climbed as much as 30% to 351,000 won, compared with an overall 0.3% fall on the benchmark Kospi index. The company is now valued at almost 10 trillion won ($US8.5bn), placing the company on course to join the all-time top 10 debuts on the South Korean stock market. Earlier this week reports emerged that South Korea\u2019s military recruitment agency was considering allowing pop and other celebrities to defer their national service. While Wednesday\u2019s initial public offering will boost their management firm\u2019s value, the band members\u2019 personal wealth will also skyrocket after they were each given more than 68,000 shares in August. Their global popularity and the billions of dollars they generate for the South Korean economy has prompted a discussion on whether it is fair to force stars to complete military service just as they reach the height of their performing powers. South Korea requires all able-bodied men aged between 18 and 28 to serve in the military for almost two years to defend the country against security threats from the nuclear-armed North. Under the existing conscription laws, BTS\u2019s 27-year old singer Jin \u2013 whose real is name Kim Seok-jin \u2013 will have to report for duty by the end of 2021. The other six members, born between 1993 and 1997, will have to follow in the coming years. The country\u2019s defence minister, Suh Wook, has said that exemption is not under consideration, but that BTS members and other popular pop culture figures might be allowed to defer. While the law grants military service exemptions or deferrals to successful international athletes and classical musicians for their contribution to South Korea\u2019s image overseas, but the measure has never been applied to pop singers and celebrities, according to the Yonhap news agency. South Korean retail investors earlier this month laid out 58.4 trillion won in orders for Big Hit shares, falling just short of a record 58.55 trillion won for the retail portion of Kakao Games\u2019 listing in September. Big Hit relies heavily on BTS, with the global chart-topping group which accounted for 87.7% of the label\u2019s revenue in the first half of 2020, according to a regulatory filing. The seven-member boy band has a huge fan base around the world, which the label has promoted effectively through social media platforms and online performances since in-person performances were cancelled because of the coronavirus pandemic. Analysts say the company has proved itself extremely online savvy, using Youtube and social media for market infiltration. It also has an unprecedented level of control over its revenue streams via its Weverse fandom platform, which has the potential to draw in other artists, analysts say. "

As preparations for your favourite boyband\u2019s latest release go, it certainly beats camping outside a record shop while bellowing their hits to keep your spirits up. Before you dismiss this as the ravings of a berserk fan who\u2019s Googled the album\u2019s title, discovered its links to a 1999 introduction to Jung written by a psychologist called Murray Stein and run with the idea, it\u2019s worth noting that the website of BTS\u2019s management company Big Hit is currently selling copies of Stein\u2019s book alongside the CDs and memorabilia. Whether you view this as a welcome return to the idea of pop music as a doorway into an new world of literature and art, or just as an inventive expansion of pop merchandising, may depend on the degree of cynicism with which you regard the entertainment agencies that control South Korea\u2019s pop stars. But what of the music at the centre of this phenomenon? Stripped of whatever associations it may have (not merely to Jung, but apparently Greek mythology and Singin\u2019 in the Rain) the 26 minutes of Persona offer up polished, Auto-Tune-heavy pop that ranges from guitar-laden hip-hop on Intro: Persona to a gentle EDM influence on the Call Me Maybe-ish Halsey collaboration Boy With Luv. Halsey isn\u2019t the only western artist to cannily hitch themselves to the K-pop juggernaut. Collaborating with Ed Sheeran on the falsetto-vocal heavy Make It Right, BTS prove smart enough to tap into the R&B end of Sheeran\u2019s oeuvre rather than adding to the teetering mountain of earnest acoustic ballads that his success has borne. It\u2019s all extremely radio-ready and sung with a breathy, close-miked intensity that gives the curious illusion of intimacy even when BTS are belting it out \u2013 a smart trick to pull off. Those charged with rapping, meanwhile, are more convincing than your average boyband denizen chancing his arm at the old lyrical flow. Nevertheless, anyone outside of the BTS Army might struggle to grasp what differentiates them from the rest of 2019\u2019s pop landscape. Occasionally, you get a faint hint of something coming, if not exactly out of left field, then at least from outside the standard pop playbook: the sinuous rhythmical shifts that underpin Mikrokosmos, the abrupt key changes in Jamais Vu, also the home of the album\u2019s most memorable melody. But ultimately, the most striking thing about the music here is how perfectly it fits in, rather than how much it stands out \u2013 which does beg the question of what it is about BTS that\u2019s caused them not merely to become globally successful but to almost singlehandedly change Anglo-American attitudes to east-Asian pop. Perhaps it is the stuff that the MTV feature referred to as \u201cthe dozens of cryptic clues and callbacks sprinkled throughout the Bangtan Universe \u2026 the deeper themes, subjects and messages within their music\u201d. The pop world isn\u2019t exactly teeming with artists referencing Jung at the moment. But whatever the answer to the mystery is, it certainly doesn\u2019t lurk within the music. "

Police said that the celebrity, born Choi Jin-ri, was discovered unconscious at her Seongnam residence on 14 October. \u201cHer manager visited her home after failing to reach her since their last call the night before,\u201d Seongnam police said.  Sulli was a member of the popular K-pop girl group f(x), launched by SM Entertainment in 2009, which achieved domestic and some international success. Sulli went on hiatus from the group in July 2014, reportedly suffering from \u201cstress-related pain\u201d, related to the circulation of rumours about her personal life. She finally left the group in August 2015 to focus on her acting career, taking a role in the 2017 superhero movie Real. She also released her debut solo single, Goblin, this summer.

            "content": "A foreign-language album recently took the No 1 position on America\u2019s album chart for the first time in 12 years \u2013 Love Yourself: Tear (which also currently sits in the Top 10 UK album chart) by South Korean boy band BTS. Since winning top social artist at 2017\u2019s Billboard music awards, they have been muscling into America\u2019s \u2013 and indeed the west\u2019s \u2013 consciousness with their genre-hopping music and intricate visual narratives. Overall, the slick, highly trained K-pop groups have slowly but surely gained traction in the west over the years. In 2012, the US-based Korean pop culture convention, KCON, drew an audience of 10,000. Last year, that figure was 149,000, but the US and UK music industries have remained oblivious to the phenomenon, or unconvinced that a record sung in Korean could ever find an English-speaking audience large enough to compete with their homegrown artists.  That theory is now shattered by BTS\u2019s success, and the spotlight is now on South Korean pop, a fast-paced, riveting and fertile industry but one with its own rules and lexicon that isn\u2019t always simple to navigate. This is your essential guide to who\u2019s who and what\u2019s what in K-Pop. Record labels, such as Universal and Sony, exist in Korea, but the entertainment agency is king and key names include JYP, YG, SM, Cube, Pledis, Starship and FNC. They audition and train hundreds of teenagers before placing a select few into new \u201cidol\u201d groups. Agencies also do everything in-house: management, PR, A&R, production and concerts/events.  Founded in 2005 by Bang Sihyuk, a former JYP songwriter, he debuted BTS in 2013, who turned Big Hit into the most profitable agency in South Korea, with a market value estimated at $1.85bn (\u00a31.38bn). BTS \u2013 rappers RM, Suga and J-hope, and vocalists Jimin, Jungkook, Jin and V \u2013 are rewriting the rules of K-pop, with their new single Fake Love taking the highest ever position (No 10) by a Korean group on the US Billboard Hot 100. A new release. Groups make multiple comebacks (usually several EPs) each year to maintain and grow their fanbases. The album and single drop simultaneously and though there are exceptions, it\u2019s one single per comeback. C is also for choreography, a vital K-pop ingredient, and idol groups practise endlessly to execute flawless, complex routines. If hip-hop has beef, then K-Pop has drama, and a lot of it. Idols embroiled in a scandal (anything from a display of bad manners to being outed as dating) is a regular occurrence, but for consistent drama, look to the fandoms. Fandom rivalry stretches back to K-Pop\u2019s first generation in the 90s where physical fights took place, while these days, there are small but noisy pockets of EXO EXO-l fans and BTS\u2019s Army who are infamous for their online spats. Fandoms fighting internally is also commonplace. There\u2019s little to rival the experimentation of K-pop. From mashing together sounds, whether it be pop, rock, hip-hop, reggae, EDM, Latin or jazz, to the idols\u2019 hair, makeup and styling (BDSM harnesses and mullets, anyone?), there\u2019s always something to hook your eyes and ears.  Fans, also known as stans, generally dedicate themselves to one group only. The relationship between fandom and group runs deep both ways, so you\u2019ll often see idols cry or do a floor bow at concerts as they thank fans for their support. K-Pop is a fluid beast that cherrypicks influences from a multitude of genres, which are then altered or combined to suit a group\u2019s concept. Popular high concepts for groups include hip-hop, school days, cute, girl crush, sexy and retro. K-Pop is just one part of the hallyu (Korean wave), a term that\u2019s been used since 1999 to encompass all of Korea\u2019s cultural exports, including television dramas and films. K-pop stars are known as idols, and often start training in an agency from a young age having been scouted or auditioned. Unlike western celebrities, idols are expected to behave impeccably on stage and off, which includes no dating. They can be penniless for years as their agency recoups the cost of training and debuting, but there are hugely lucrative opportunities from advertising deals and sponsorships. Older groups (10+ years active), such as Bigbang, SHINee, Girls\u2019 Generation, Shinwha and Sechs Kies, remain popular, while the most talked-about current groups include Twice, Wanna One, EXO and BTS. Agencies continue to heavily court this cash-rich market, re-recording songs or releasing original material for specifically for Japanese audiences. K-pop in its modern form began in 1992 with Seo Taiji and Boys (one of whom was Yang Hyun-suk, who went on to form YG Entertainment) \u2013 they rattled the public with their sociopolitical lyrics and musicality that was indebted to new jack swing and the Beastie Boys. K-pop is often broken down into generations, although the time brackets for each are hotly contested, making it debatable whether we\u2019re in the third or fourth generation of idols.  Some of the most widely covered cases are idols trying to extricate themselves from iron-clad contracts, with some cases dragging on for years. Meanwhile, Korean law allows for people to be sued for defamatory comments even if they are true, so agencies often threaten anti-fans who post negative comments online with legal action.  A good MV (music video) is just as important as a good song in K-pop and making a standard video doesn\u2019t leave much change from $100,000. MVs deemed expensive cost more than $200,000, while there\u2019s even a couple that ran to US$1m. Some of the best producers are Lumpens, VM Project Architecture, Zanybros, Digipedi, Tigercave and Studio Naive. Agencies frequently sign producers and songwriters such as Bumzu (Pledis), Teddy Park (YG) or Kenzie (SM) to work exclusively on their acts, but there are plenty of independent Korean creatives and a significant international presence on K-pop records, such as Brits LDN Noise, Swedes Caesar & Loui and Andreas \u00d6berg, and Americans such as Kevin Randolph, Davey Nate, and the LA-based collective Devine-Channel. Some of the best known Koreans include Shinsadong Tiger, Primary, Slow Rabbit, Pdogg, Brave Brothers, Sweetune and Black Eyed Pilseung.  All new groups are known as rookies, and the consensus is that you remain a rookie for around two years. The term monster rookie is used for groups (usually from bigger agencies) who find significant early success, such as NCT, Gfriend and Blackpink. When smaller agencies debut an act, they are frequently referred to as \u201cnugu groups\u201d; nugu is Korean for \u201cwho\u201d, but also used to describe someone as a nobody. Sasaengs are the obsessed fans who have been known to break into idols\u2019 houses, put recording devices in hotel rooms, pay off staff at phone or flight companies for an star\u2019s number or book seats next to their bias (favourite member) and crash private events, such as weddings.  The legendary idol-training system is a gruelling schedule of, primarily, vocal and dance lessons. A pre-dawn start and witching-hour finish is routine. Three years is an average training period, but this can be as long as eight years. R&B singer G.Soul holds the record for the longest training period, an endurance-testing 15 years.  A broadcasting app and website that idol groups use to communicate in real time with fans, as well as load prerecorded shows. V Live records every broadcast, so that they or the fans can add subtitles afterwards, helping international fans stay connected. That many K-pop self-proclaimed \u201cworld tours\u201d tend to exclude half the world is a long-running fan joke. The consistent focus has been on Asia and North America but, in recent years, K-pop\u2019s ever-growing popularity has seen more tours play Australia, Europe and South America, where there\u2019s been huge surges of interest. Like everywhere else, racism is a significant issue in Korea, and prejudice is often rife in the entertainment industry. Blackface is still used on mainstream comedy skit shows; appropriation of black culture, including gestures, language and hair, can be seen regularly in K-pop (and groups including Block B, Big Bang, EXO, GOT7 and 4Minute have all encountered international criticism for doing so); while darker skin is also seen as a negative trait, with companies, fans and media whitewashing idol images (making them appear lighter skinned than they are in reality). Agencies and Korean broadcast companies make heavy use of YouTube, but the platform is a goldmine of fan-made content: compilation videos, playlists, subtitled content (lyrics, idol reality and variety shows), vlogs/reactions, fancams from concerts and appearances and ripped Korea-only shows. Without these, K-pop\u2019s global expansion would have been far slower. Being a little crazy helps. Appearing on Korea\u2019s popular variety shows is a great way of raising an idol\u2019s profile as well as that of their group, but these are tough gigs that require quick wit, charm and a willingness to get involved in anything-goes situations. Idols with \u201c4D\u201d (eccentric or sassy) personalities do especially well, like BTS\u2019s V, Exid\u2019s Hani, GOT7\u2019s Jackson, and Super Junior\u2019s Hee-chul. Knowing Brothers, Running Man, Weekly Idol and Netflix\u2019s new original Busted are just some of the shows to watch.  "

            "title": "Digitally-savvy and passionate, K-pop fans' Trump activism should come as no surprise",
            "content": "On Tuesday 2 June, Grammy award-winning songwriter and music artist Tiffany Red returned home from a trip to her local mall, where she had encountered the national guard armed with large rifles, an experience that left Red \u201ctraumatized\u201d. Exactly one week before, George Floyd had been killed in Minneapolis, and tensions in the country were rising as hundreds of thousands took to the streets in protest. Tuesday 2 June was also #BlackoutTuesday, a global \u201csocial media moment\u201d that grew out of the music industry\u2019s #TheShowMustBePaused, an initiative created to \u201chold the industry at large\u201d \u2013 including major corporations and their partners who benefit from the efforts, struggles and successes of Black people \u2013 accountable. Over the past month or so, it\u2019s been widely reported to much acclaim that K-pop fans are mobilising in social media spaces to help fight injustice. The majority of this was done thanks to K-pop fans\u2019 savvy and long history of mobilising digitally to support their favourite stars, but that\u2019s just the beginning. For those not in the know, fans of South Korea\u2019s pop music scene, aka K-pop, first went viral in recent days by engaging in a kind of vigilante activism, as fans across the world supported the Black Lives Matters movement. They did this not only through social media and driving immense donations, but also by taking action to foil police operations aimed at identifying BLM protestors \u2013 by urging fans to submit their fancam footage to a US police department \u2013 and hijacking racist hashtags. Last weekend, they gained new levels of attention for their role in Donald Trump\u2019s poorly attended rally in Tulsa. Both TikTok users and K-pop fans \u2013 which often overlap \u2013 came forward in the aftermath to reveal they had mobilised to request tickets, inflating expectations for turnout. Though the US president\u2019s campaign has denied the impact on the actual turnout, there was no denying the proof individuals shared across social media that these young people had been integral in boosting the pre-announced ticketing numbers. These two particular incidents resulted in a raft of articles written about the activism of K-pop fans, especially in English-language media. Often, a sense of surprise set the tone of the story as people tried to come to terms with K-pop fan mobilisation. K-pop fans \u2013 the latest in a long line of pop music fans being vilified and discredited \u2013 have regularly been scorned across Internet spaces as an irritant, dropping fancams seemingly without care and trending hashtags nonstop. Recent events have forced a reckoning with that stereotype. But it shouldn\u2019t be surprising, because any stereotype of K-pop fans is an inaccurate rendering of a massive amount of people around the world. Though there\u2019s no confirmed number of K-pop fans across the globe, in 2019 the Korea Foundation\u2019s data showed that there were more than 99 million fans worldwide participating in fan clubs dedicated to South Korean culture, including K-pop and K-dramas. While it\u2019s easy to say \u201cK-pop fans\u201d whenever discussing the movement, it\u2019s not a centralised, formal group - it\u2019s individuals who happen to be K-pop fans activating and using their combined values to make something happen. There is huge diversity in this group, some of it good, and some of it bad. Even amid all the recent anti-racist activism, Black K-pop fans have been vocal about longterm and ongoing racism in K-pop spaces, with many expressing concern about how this very activism is being received. In fandoms, there is always a breadth of views \u2013 Harry Potter\u2019s fandom comes to mind, especially in light of Rowling\u2019s recent transphobic comments. Contemporary fandoms are very well-suited and well-prepared for the kinds of political activism we\u2019ve seen in recent weeks. K-pop in 2020 is very much about the organisational skills of different fandoms. Who can stream more? Who can buy more albums? How many trends can you trend worldwide in any given month? Organising and navigating digital spaces are old hat for K-pop audiences nowadays. So for those K-pop fans who are politically inclined, even if they\u2019re unable to attend protests physically, they are able to use the tools they\u2019ve honed for fandom projects to create good.  We saw an example of this when the fandom for BTS, the best-selling artists in South Korean history, who are known as ARMY, joined together to collectively raise $US1m for various Black Lives Matters-associated organisations to match BTS and its company\u2019s, Big Hit Entertainment\u2019s, donation. ARMY surpassed $1m within 24 hours.  We have seen this kind of fundraising power before \u2013 raising money for causes as disparate as the Australian bushfire recovery to buying trees and rice for charities across the world. We saw another example of this when fans rallied together to register for tickets to Trump\u2019s rally. For K-pop fans who regularly engage in mass streaming, buy merchandise in bulk, deal with the chaos that is trying to get the ticket you want for a concert, and numerous other similar sorts of activities, coming up with fake emails and phone numbers to register for a single rally, sometimes requesting hundreds of tickets in one go, proved to be small fry. More than being the meme of the moment, the recent high-profile examples of activism are the work of the individuals who make up these K-pop fandoms, and there\u2019s no saying what will come next now that fandoms have learned to harness their political power. Nowadays it\u2019s common for K-pop fandoms to create goals to try to break new records, always aiming higher and higher. If that \u201csky\u2019s the limit\u201d momentum carries into social justice, it means that these instances may just be the tip of the iceberg.

The awards are voted for in a complex online poll and cover TV, music and pop culture as well as movies, and lean towards commercial and mainstream releases. Avengers: Infinity War was named best movie and action movie, with Scarlett Johansson named best female movie star, while Black Panther took two acting awards \u2013 best male movie star for Chadwick Boseman, and best action star for Danai Gurira. (Both actors also appeared as the same characters in Avengers: Infinity War.) In a feat unlikely to be repeated at any other awards ceremonies, EL James adaptation Fifty Shades Freed also took two awards, for best drama movie and best drama star for Jamie Dornan. The TV categories were dominated by YA fantasy series Shadowhunters, adapted from Cassandra Clare\u2019s popular book series The Mortal Instruments. Shadowhunters won best show, and best male and female TV stars for Harry Shum Jr and Katherine McNamara respectively, as well as most binge-worthy show. Jimmy Fallon won best night-time talk show, while the Kardashian clan had two entries: one for best reality show (Keeping Up With the Kardashians) and the other for Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian for best reality star. Korean boyband BTS dominated the music awards, winning best song and music video for Idol, as well as best group and social celebrity.

            "title": "Three members of K-pop band BTS test positive for Covid",
            "content": "Three members of the K-pop superstar group BTS have been infected with coronavirus after returning from abroad, their management agency said on Sunday. RM and Jin were diagnosed with Covid-19 on Saturday evening, the Big Hit Music agency said in a statement. It earlier said another member, Suga, tested positive for the virus on Friday. All three took their second jabs in August, the agency said. The other four members of the seven-strong ban are J-Hope, Jungkook, V and Jimin. According to the agency, RM has exhibited no particular symptoms, while Jin is showing mild symptoms including light fever and is undergoing self-treatment at home. The agency said on Friday that Suga did not have symptoms and was administering self-care at home in accordance with the guidelines of the health authorities. RM had tested negative after returning from the US earlier this month following his personal schedule there. But he was later diagnosed with the virus ahead of his scheduled release from self-quarantine, the agency said. After returning to South Korea this month, Jin underwent PCR tests twice \u2013 upon arrival and later before his release from self-quarantine \u2013 and tested negative both times. But he had flu-like symptoms on Saturday afternoon before he took another PCR test that came back positive, the agency said. Media reports said he also traveled to the US. Suga, who has had a number of personal engagements in the US during the band\u2019s official time off, was diagnosed with Covid during quarantine after returning from the US, the agency said. The agency said it would continue to provide support for the three members for their speedy recovery. It said it would cooperate with the requests and guidelines of the South Korean health authorities. Since their debut in 2013, BTS have garnered global recognition for their self-produced music and activism, which includes giving a speech at the United Nations and publicly calling out anti-Asian racism. The band topped the Billboard Hot 100 chart three times in 2020, and was nominated for prominent music awards like Billboard Music Awards and MTV Video Music Awards. "

            "content": "A TV network in Japan has cancelled an appearance by the popular K-pop band BTS, after a photo emerged of one of its members wearing a T-shirt that appeared to celebrate the atomic bombing of Hiroshima. The seven-member boy band, who have built a huge international following since they formed in 2013, were due to appear on TV Asahi\u2019s flagship Music Station show on Friday evening. But the broadcaster withdrew its invitation this week after a photo of Jimin wearing the T-shirt went viral. I can never accept the act that #BTS member wore the atomic bomb T-shirts humanely. The problem is not the relation between Japan and Korea. It's just humanity. pic.twitter.com/x37nZs8pJG The back of the shirt features several lines repeating the words \u201cPatriotism ourhistory (sic) Liberation Korea\u201d, a reference to the end of Japan\u2019s 35-year colonial rule of the Korean peninsula. It also carries images of what appears to be a mushroom cloud created by an exploding atomic bomb, and of Koreans celebrating their liberation from Japanese rule in August 1945, the month the US carried out nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Jimin, 23, was reportedly photographed wearing the shirt last year on 15 August, when Koreans mark the anniversary of the end of the Japanese occupation. \u201cWe have seen news that a T-shirt worn by one of the members has set off a furore. After asking their record company about this, we made the decision to postpone their appearance on our Nov 9 show,\u201d TV Asahi said. BTS apologised for the cancellation but made no reference to the T-shirt. \u201cWe apologise for disappointing fans who were looking forward to this. BTS will continue their efforts to connect with fans on stage and also through music,\u201d the group said. The row comes amid a sharp deterioration in ties between Seoul and Tokyo that began when South Korea suggested it would revisit a 2015 agreement over Japan\u2019s prewar and wartime use of tens of thousands of sex slaves, most of whom were from the Korean peninsula. Japan then withdrew from an international naval review in South Korea after Seoul demanded that it remove the rising sun ensign from its warship. Many South Koreans regard the flag as a symbol of Japanese militarism and colonial rule. Last month, the South Korean supreme court ordered a Japanese company to compensate four South Koreans it had used as forced wartime labour \u2013 a decision the Japanese government has called \u201cunacceptable\u201d. The cancellation of the band\u2019s TV appearance comes on the eve of their Japan tour, which begins in Tokyo next Tuesday, and five months after they became the first K-pop band to top the Billboard 200 album chart with Love Yourself: Tear. This week their ninth single in Japan, Fake Love/Airplane pt 2, topped the country\u2019s Oricon daily singles chart. The band, who are also known as the Bangtan Boys, performed in Paris last month in front of the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, with whom they later posed for photos. They have also played to huge audiences in London and New York. "

            "title": "From tuna fishing to teen love: the producer behind K-pop\u2019s biggest stars ",
            "content": "The biggest K-pop band in the world inch towards being the biggest global pop act full stop \u2013 the video for this latest single was played 45m times on YouTube in the first 24 hours of release, which is a new record. And with good reason: it is an absolute juggernaut, with a terrace chant chorus, Eurovision-level saxophone, and a surprisingly welcome return for Nicki Minaj to pop-dance beats. The group are folding ever more English language into their tracks as their star rises in the west, resulting in a dizzying bilingual hybrid. Quite simply the best track yet from Empress Of, AKA LA singer-songwriter-producer Lorely Rodriguez. Her 2015 debut album was head-turning for its sensual, impulsive pop smarts, but not all the choruses totally connected. No such problem here \u2013 the central melody is riveting: feathery and near-falsetto, it drops into a heartwrenching final line as as Rodriguez laments her disconnection from the man she\u2019s with. Shades of Jessie Ware and her regular collaborator Dev Hynes, perhaps, but outshining both with a song that already feels classic. He has never truly broken into the mainstream, seen sometimes as a mere curio or clotheshorse, but Theophilus London is a valuable MC, announcing earlier than most that rap should think bigger when it comes to genre boundaries. Everyone from Tegan and Sara\u2019s Sara Quinn and Leon Ware to Kanye West have appeared on his tracks; now he recruits Giggs for a remix of his track Bebey. The bright, funky, loping beat draws out the puckish side of his London guest, his phone blowing up as he announces his greatness and does a spot of shopping on Bond Street. Marie Davidson\u2019s voice is one of the biggest pleasures in contemporary electronic music. French-accented, often drily amused and given to rants, declarations and snatches of internal monologue, she continues the grand style of talky electro on from the likes of Miss Kittin. On So Right, the first track from forthcoming album Working Class Woman, a quiet side-of-the-dancefloor reverie (\u201cHe\u2019s got me feeling so high / man this is so nice\u201d) builds into a full house diva performance, over a classic Chicago bassline. The result is a track that essays the body high of club music and shows how close that feeling is to the erotic. It\u2019s gloriously populist, but still retains Davidson\u2019s indelible stamp; expect to hear this everywhere. A new supergroup that is quite formidable in its collective angst: Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus are all experts at emotional torpor, articulated with pin-drop clarity amid moping guitars, but thankfully don\u2019t cancel each other out when they come together. Three tracks from their forthcoming EP have been released, all excellent. Stay Down is simultaneously the most morose and the most uplifting, Baker taking the lead vocal for a song of compromised romance that builds to a stunning arena-indie climax. Downbeat, understated R&B might look easy on paper \u2013 smoky vocal, minimalist drums, job done \u2013 but the patchiness of, say, the Jorja Smith album shows how tough it is to pull off. Kenzie, a Bostonian singer-songwriter now living in London, is managing it, though, with her debut tracks. Over Dark July\u2019s softly pattering breakbeat, she sings a beautiful, fragmentary summer love story with perfect huskiness, speeding from meet-cute to crying breakup in the space of a chorus. Its nagging melody is deceptively simple, but will set up shop in your brain if you\u2019re not careful. You can take comfort, in this mixed-up world, from the fact that every year there\u2019ll be a new Kurt Vile record: it won\u2019t be very different from the last, and it\u2019ll be great. On this one there is the usual bold and beautiful Neil Young-ish strumming, the glittering yet unshowy solos, and the drily amused slacker vocals. \u201cHow beautiful to take a bite out of the world,\u201d Vile muses as he kicks around his home town on the way to a long psychedelic outro. Beautiful and beguiling bedroom pop here, from rising London-based producer Jess Bartlet. The other two tracks from her Comrade EP flirt with a 4/4 techno pulse, but the title track has sweet and subtle syncopation under a glittering curtain of multitracked harp. It could have been twee in its sheer prettiness, but the jazzy sax and trumpet solos keep it cutely idiosyncratic, and Bartlet\u2019s vocal in the chorus \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll be there when you need me\u201d \u2013 is powerful in its calm certainty. Love blokes screaming their larynxes out in near-unintelligible roars but can\u2019t get on board with the double kick-drums of straight metal nor the pomposity of the doom scene? Thou are your new favourite band. Despite being from Louisiana they dress like a group of Transylvanian vampires going to a cabaret evening, and have a great interplay between giant doom chords, stirring melodic progressions, and quite splashy, punkish drums. Elimination Rhetoric has the added bonus of an uplifting bit of soloing, segueing into a passage of joyous headbanging. \u201cI can\u2019t help myself, don\u2019t talk to me!\u201d Bryan Funck declares through his apparently rotted throat. One of the year\u2019s best and creepiest 12ins has been released: Don\u2019t DJ\u2019s All Love Affairs Fail But They Never End, a dub-techno epic that kicks off with Veles. Created by Berliner Florian Meyer, it has a tiny whisper of his earlier work with \u201cexotic\u201d sounds such as marimbas and flutes, in the subtle pan-pipe pattern on the offbeat. But that is met with absolute menace in the form of what sounds like a detuned, timestretched monastic chant. Its restless beat never quite finds its footing, and what is that scurrying and creaking at the back of the mix? This is a whole universe of glorious disquiet. When Jin from the superstar boyband BTS released Super Tuna \u2013 an upbeat song about his favourite pastime, fishing \u2013 it instantly went viral. The track, written to commemorate the star\u2019s birthday, has logged more than 53m YouTube views since December, and on TikTok the #SuperTuna hashtag has inspired a viral dance challenge. With the popularity of groups such as BTS and the girl group Blackpink, which have international fanbases that number in the tens of millions, K-pop dominates pop culture far beyond its South Korean homeland. As the significance of the industry intensifies, so too does the importance of the teams that power K-pop \u2013 the creators behind every act responsible for music, fashion, choreography and more. Bumzu is among them. The 30-year-old solo artist turned songwriter-producer, who co-produced Super Tuna, has emerged as one of the industry\u2019s most influential people in K-pop. Seventeen, his biggest act, has sold more than 10m albums in South Korea and had four No 1 hits on Billboard\u2019s World Albums chart. Bumzu has also worked on tracks for other big names including Nu\u2019est, Shinee, Rain and 2PM. \u201cFrankly, I feel a lot of pressure. There are many times when that pressure gnaws away at me. But it\u2019s also true that this feeling drives me to become stronger again,\u201d said Bumzu, whose real name is Kye Beom-joo. K-pop forms part of a multibillion-dollar industry that has become one of South Korea\u2019s most valuable cultural products, with the country\u2019s content industry exporting a record $11.92bn in 2020. The popularity of K-pop continues to grow amid the rise of the Korean Wave, which also includes film, TV, food and beauty. On top of being a cultural phenomenon, it has also emerged as an important source of political soft power for South Korea \u2013 and one of fanbased activism in support of causes ranging from climate action to human rights. Yet even Bumzu struggles to pinpoint the reasons for K-pop\u2019s global appeal. \u201cIt\u2019s like asking why barbecue is so delicious and being told it\u2019s because there\u2019s meat,\u201d Bumzu jokes. \u201cI don\u2019t think we can define K-pop by just a few factors. We just make music that moves the heart.\u201d Bumzu grew up in Seoul, surrounded by music. A talented child violinist, he was already thinking up tunes and lyrics in his head at the age of five. His older brother was passionate about music and filled the house with equipment, which left a lasting impression on Bumzu. He wasn\u2019t allowed to touch anything for fear he would break it, so he began working part-time jobs and saving money to buy his own equipment. He explored music production using computer software, not too far removed from the techniques he uses today. Bumzu was fascinated with visual kei \u2013 a mixture of glam rock, metal and punk popular in Japan since the 80s. Later he fell in love with hip-hop, making beats and singing over them, and also R&B, listening to Boyz II Men and Brian McKnight on a loop. By high school, he was determined to become a musician. In Seoul\u2019s hip university district of Hongdae, he became active in the underground music scene. \u201cAt the time, we called it underground. Most of the people who made music there are now creating what the public calls K-hip-hop. It\u2019s no longer underground,\u201d he says. Bumzu\u2019s career as a singer took off after competing in the television talent show Superstar K in 2012. Despite not making it to the end, he gained popularity and released his first EP a year later. He joined Pledis Entertainment \u2013 an agency recently acquired by the parent company of Big Hit Music, which is behind BTS \u2013 and began working as a vocal coach for a group of young trainees who later became Seventeen. Bumzu was responsible for Seventeen\u2019s first hit, Adore U, about a teenage boy\u2019s innocent love confession. \u201cAs I composed the song, I thought that this would be the perfect debut single for a group,\u201d Bumzu says. \u201cIt helped me develop and refine my style.\u201d Most of Bumzu\u2019s day is spent writing songs for artists, working in the studio and attending meetings. There are few breaks. He is constantly interacting with other producers, artists and label representatives. \u201cWe live in an era of collaboration and open communication, and nobody can accomplish everything or shine alone. I have a team to strengthen my expertise, and I always consult professionals in other areas,\u201d he says. One of the most important parts of Bumzu\u2019s job is to give each act a unique sound. \u201cEvery band, every artist, has their own style, direction or goal,\u201d he says. \u201cThe most important topic we worry about every day is the unique flair, the colour of this artist, this team.\u201d With Seventeen, Bumzu works closest with band member, close friend and gym buddy Woozi, who co-writes and co-produces many of the group\u2019s discography. \u201cHe\u2019s a very talented artist and songwriter,\u201d Bumzu says. \u201cWe share ideas, discuss a lot and complement each other\u2019s techniques. \u201cI once asked Seventeen member Hoshi to think of the choreography first. We then worked on the rhythm from it and then the melody after that. I don\u2019t have a fixed order.\u201d Bumzu says the composition of a song starts and ends with inspiration, which can come from anything. \u201cThere are times when I make track ideas and melodies in my head while holding dumbbells at the gym,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m in the same boat with the singers I produce for. We know that teamwork is important and everyone tries to go in one direction. If I row the opposite way, we can\u2019t sail where we want to go. Even a small paddle can have a big impact.\u201d "

            "content": "A military court jailed the disgraced former K-pop star Seungri for three years on Thursday for arranging sex services and other charges stemming from a sex and gambling scandal, according to reports. The 30-year-old singer from the popular boyband Big Bang, who retired from showbusiness as the scandal mounted and later enlisted in the military, was found guilty on all nine counts against him, according to various media reports. Big Bang enjoyed widespread fame after their 2006 debut, and Seungri \u2013 real name Lee Seung-hyun \u2013 went on to become a successful businessman. He was convicted of arranging sex services for potential investors in his business, as well as overseas gambling at luxurious casinos in Las Vegas involving illicit foreign exchange transactions. \u201cIt is hard to see the defendant was not aware of financial payments paid to the women for sex,\u201d the judge, Hwang Min-je, was cited as saying. \u201cIt appears that he carried out systematic sexual prostitution.\u201d Seungri had changed his testimony under police questioning and in court, he added, and \u201clacked credibility\u201d. The singer was also ordered to pay 1.15bn won ($1m) in restitution. The investigation into the scandal surrounding him uncovered a spate of allegations against other musicians and personnel at YG Entertainment, Seungri\u2019s former agency and one of K-pop\u2019s biggest management firms. It prompted the agency\u2019s chief executive, Yang Hyun-suk, to step down, facing inquiries of his own into illicit gambling. Reaction to the verdict was swift on Thursday, with many users online saying Seungri\u2019s punishment was too light for the offences. \u201cWhile it is fortunate he is finally being jailed, the term is too short,\u201d a user on Naver, South Korea\u2019s largest portal, posted. Another said: \u201cIt should\u2019ve been 30 years, not three.\u201d The verdict came a month before he was due to be discharged from his mandatory military service. All able-bodied South Korean men are obliged to fulfil about two years of military service to defend the country from nuclear-armed North Korea, with which it remains technically at war. "

            "content": "Government guidelines aimed at promoting more diversity in South Korea\u2019s K-pop world have been withdrawn after critics said they amounted to state censorship of a booming industry. The guidelines issued last week by the ministry of gender equality and family complained that K-pop stars looked too alike, saying \u201cthe problem of \u2026 uniformity among singers is serious\u201d, and noting most idols were thin and wore identical makeup and skimpy outfits. The paragraphs that caused offence advised restricting the number of K-pop singers who appear on a TV show, for fear that similar appearances may promote unrealistic and narrow standards of beauty. \u201cAre the singers on TV music shows twins? They seriously look identical. Most are idol group members,\u201d the guidelines say, according to the Korea Times. \u201cMost of them are skinny and have similar hairstyles and makeup with outfits exposing their bodies.\u201d A petition was submitted to the Korean government calling for the ministry\u2019s abolition on the grounds that it was trying to censor \u201chow female pop stars look\u201d, reported the Korea JoongAng Daily. The petition said the ministry was going \u201cdown the path of [dictator] Chun Doo-hwan, starting with internet censorship and now appearance censorship\u201d. Comparisons with the dictator, who ruled South Korea from 1980-1988, were also drawn by opposition politicians, including Ha Tae-keung of the minor opposition Bareunmirae party, reported the Korea Times. \u201cThe gender ministry says K-pop idols should not star together on television because they are all skinny and pretty with pale skin,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cWhat\u2019s the difference between this and the crackdowns on the length of hair and skirts during the military dictatorship of Chun Doo-hwan?\u201dThe government said the guidelines were not mandatory but were aimed at addressing the negative impact of unrealistic beauty standards. But after criticism, the ministry said on Tuesday it would withdraw the recommendation after it had \u201ccaused unnecessary confusion\u201d. It claimed it had neither the intention nor authority to control TV production and it had simply tried to \u201cprevent media, which has big influence on people\u2019s daily life, from undermining human rights or fostering discrimination unintentionally\u201d. South Korea is famous for its cosmetic surgery industry, with as many as one third of young women in the country believed to have gone under the knife. In 2017 all four members of the K-pop band SixBomb went through extensive plastic surgery, including nose jobsand breast implants, before releasing a single. A series of videos showed the four women visiting a clinic, strutting into an operating theatre and lying on the operating table. Last year, South Korean women began a social media movement reacting against the country\u2019s culture of exacting beauty standards, which suggested women engage in cosmetic surgery and laborious multi-step skin care regimes. The movement, called Escape the Corset, saw Korean women post makeup-free selfies and videos of themselves destroying their makeup, in a rebellion against beauty norms.

            "content": "Seungri\u2019s taste for the high life earned him the nickname the Great Gatsby of Korea. But now the singer, a member of one of South Korea\u2019s biggest K-pop bands, is facing charges that he procured prostitutes for businessmen in some of Seoul\u2019s most fashionable nightclubs. The youngest member of Big Bang has announced he will retire to fight the charges and to spare his management agency, YG Entertainment, and fellow band members further embarrassment, according to South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency. The decision came after news of the scandal spread on social media on Monday. Shares in YG slid by almost 16%, while other K-pop management companies also suffered losses. The 28-year-old was arrested on suspicion of supplying prostitutes to foreign investors at several nightclubs in Seoul\u2019s upmarket Gangnam district. Prostitution is illegal in South Korea. The charges against Seungri carry a prison sentence of up to three years. He has denied the allegations. Police are also investigating claims that the Burning Sun nightclub, where Seungri was a public relations director, was involved in illegal drug use, sexual assaults and police corruption, Yonhap reported. The club\u2019s owner, Lee Moon Ho, said the allegations were unfounded rumours. Seungri\u2019s arrest is the latest scandal to tarnish the reputation of K-pop, part of the globally successful Hallyu wave of Korean pop culture. The boy band BTS alone are worth about $3.5bn to the South Korean economy every year, according to the Hyundai Research Institute. Seungri is not the first member of Big Bang to have made the headlines for the wrong reasons. In 2011, G-Dragon was caught smoking marijuana during a concert tour of Japan, and in 2017, rapper TOP received a 10-month suspended sentence for marijuana use. The incidents involving YG stars prompted some to joke that the company\u2019s initials stand for Yak-Guk \u2013 Korean for drugstore. Seungri, whose real name is Lee Seung-hyun, wrote on his Instagram account that he had decided to quit the pop industry. \u201cIt would be better for me to retire from the entertainment scene at this point,\u201d he said. \u201cAs this scandal is too big, I have decided to retire. As for the ongoing investigation, I will take it seriously to clear myself of all the allegations. \u201cI give my heartfelt, sincere thanks to fans at home and abroad who gave their love for the past 10 years, and I think this should be it for the sake of the reputation of YG and Big Bang.\u201d The investigation has prompted speculation the singer will be unable to begin his national service this month. All able-bodied South Korean men aged 18-35 must serve for a minimum of 21 months, a measure seen as a deterrent against North Korean aggression. Seungri was due to enrol on 25 March but could ask for a deferment while he addresses the allegations. Police have said they would still be able to conduct their investigation while Seungri is serving in the army, and military officials have said the singer would have to submit a written request for deferment.  South Korean media reported that officers had confiscated Seungri\u2019s passport now that he was officially regarded as a suspect. The quintet, who have sold more than 140m records since their 2006 debut, are taking a break while three of them carry out military service. Seungri has cancelled the remaining dates in his solo tour. Much of the reaction to his arrest has been damning, with some fans calling for him to be kicked out of the band. \u201cI have faced heavy criticism from the public for the last month and a half and I\u2019m being probed by all investigative authorities in the country,\u201d he said in his Instagram post. \u201cAs I\u2019ve been branded as a \u2018national traitor\u2019, I cannot stand the fact that I\u2019m harming others for my own sake.\u201d But some fans pledged their support for the singer. Bloomberg quoted one social media user as saying: \u201cWe call on the real fans\u2019 voice, do not fall into the shameless trap, we support Seungri!\u201d "

            "title": "Blackpink: The Album review \u2013 brilliance from the world's biggest girl band",
            "content": "In some benighted corners of the internet, the big news a couple of weeks ago was the latest battle in the ongoing war between fans of South Korean boyband BTS and fans of fellow K-pop stars Blackpink. Ever-vigilant for perceived slurs against their idols, the BTS Army took exception to an innocuous remark made by Blackpink\u2019s Jennie Kim about paving the way for other K-pop acts: apparently she should have mentioned that BTS were successful overseas prior to Blackpink. Cue much mutual abuse being slung and pleas for calm from more level heads, fruitlessly invoking feminist solidarity and the grim spectre of online bullying. You can see where the rivalry has come from. Barely four years on from their debut release, Blackpink seem to be repeating BTS\u2019s boundary-breaking success, racking up commercial achievements that would once have been unthinkable for a non-Anglophone artist. They are currently the most-followed girl group on Spotify and the most-subscribed band on YouTube. Just as BTS\u2019s success drew artists from Ed Sheeran to Nicki Minaj into their orbit, so The Album features guest appearances by David Guetta, Selena Gomez and Cardi B, the co-author of WAP finding herself in more prim company than usual. The metaphors of Ice Cream aside \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re the cherry piece, so stay on top of me\u201d \u2013 the closest The Album comes to the mention of sex is Bet You Wanna\u2019s reference to a gentleman keen to give the song\u2019s narrator something mysteriously called \u201can all-night hug\u201d. And yet, a comparison of The Album with BTS\u2019s last album reveals them to be very different propositions. Map of the Soul: 7 was a blockbuster, 75 minutes of music apparently inspired by Dr Murray Stein\u2019s book Jung\u2019s Map of the Soul. Its release was heralded by a \u201cglobal public art project\u201d involving both Antony Gormley and \u201cenvironmental artist\u201d Tom\u00e1s Saraceno, the latter building a solar-powered hot air balloon that flew a human a record-breaking 577 feet over Argentina\u2019s Salinas Grande. By contrast, The Album lasts a fraction over 24 minutes. No one has cited Jungian psychoanalysis among its influences, nor has anyone commissioned a hot air balloon, solar-powered or otherwise. Instead, the only truly massive thing about it \u2013 apart from its anticipated sales \u2013 is its packaging. Parents of Blinks (ie Blackpink\u2019s superfans) beware: the top bundle of album swag costs \u00a3134, featuring three luxury CD box sets, a regular CD, four signed art cards and \u2013 for the insatiable Blackpink stan trapped in the early 1990s \u2013 four different cassette versions. This highly efficient extraction of pocket money runs the risk of making music seem like a secondary consideration, but that doesn\u2019t tally with The Album\u2019s contents. It deals in precision-tooled rap-influenced pop that makes most western artists\u2019 efforts in that area seem wan. Its songs are unrelenting three-minute bombardments of hooks: barely a second passes where you\u2019re not in the presence of a melody you struggle to erase from your brain, a snappy throwaway aside anyone else would build an entire chorus around \u2013 How You Like That\u2019s cry of \u201clook up in the sky, it\u2019s a bird, it\u2019s a plane\u201d is a prime example \u2013 or an equally snappy production touch: the Popcorn-esque melody that ping-pongs behind Lovesick Girls\u2019 chorus, the woozy-sounding staccato synths that open Ice Cream. This production approach reaches a deranged height on Crazy Over You, its backing track constructed from a patchwork of eclectic sounds \u2013 bursts of Bollywood-ish strings, flute, rave-y synth stabs, a Brazilian cuica, what sounds like a Japanese gottan \u2013 interspersed with bursts of sub-bass. You\u2019re struck by the sense that the quality control has been set very high, and that the writers and producers \u2013 old hands at K-pop and big western names including Ryan Tedder and the team behind much of Ariana Grande\u2019s Sweetener alike \u2013 have felt impelled to bring their A-game. The possible exception is the lyricists. Devoid of an overarching concept and eschewing the need to show a human heart at the centre of the K-pop machine \u2013 the raison d\u2019etre behind much of BTS\u2019s recent output \u2013 it sticks to the topics of how great Blackpink are and how that perennial bugbear The Haters aren\u2019t getting to them. In fairness, given the vociferousness of said Haters, perhaps the latter subject has more heft in the world of K-pop. Much as anyone who shells out \u00a3134 for it might quail at its running time \u2013 you\u2019ve just paid nearly \u00a35.60 for every minute of music it contains \u2013 as a listening experience, its brevity works in The Album\u2019s favour. There\u2019s no time for longueurs, no padding, no ponderous ballads. Instead it\u2019s the musical equivalent of the moment in the video for their 2018 hit Ddu-Du-Ddu-Du, where Jennie Kim suddenly appears, clad in a pair of 18-hole Doc Martens and eating a giant bucket of popcorn while sitting on top of a tank that\u2019s covered in squares of mirrored glass like a disco ball: striking, glittery, depthless and rather impressive. Romy: LifetimeThe XX singer\u2019s solo debut involves an unexpected diversion into peak-time electronic club banger territory \u2013 her vocal undercuts the anthemic chorus with just enough yearning melancholy.

            "content": "The death this week of the South Korean singer and actor Sulli has turned the spotlight on the darkest corners of the highly pressurised K-pop industry and sparked anger over the failure of management agencies to protect their stars from the menace of \u201ctoxic fandom\u201d. Sulli, a former member of the group f(x), had spoken publicly about her mental health problems and shock at her death has led to calls for greater support for performers. Authorities said she was suffering from severe depression and are investigating suicide as a possible cause of death. Sulli, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri, was one of a growing number of female South Korean singers and actors to have been targeted by online vitriol, often from anonymous male fans enraged by their idols\u2019 refusal to conform to social norms. Her \u201ccrimes\u201d had included live-streaming a drinking session with friends and her decision not to wear a bra in public. She also revealed that she was in a relationship at the zenith of her singing career, defying the industry\u2019s carefully crafted image of young female stars as sexually desirable but inexperienced. She smashed other taboos, too, hosting a TV series about how online abuse had contributed to her anxiety disorder and social phobia, in a country with a strong cultural resistance to discussing mental illness. \u201cShe expressed her views about what was intrinsically wrong in our society about how female stars are supposed to behave,\u201d said Prof Yunkim Ji-yeong, an expert on Korean gender issues at the Institute of Body and Culture at Konkuk University in Seoul. The messages of sympathy that flooded the internet after news of Sulli\u2019s death emerged on Monday also criticised the culture of South Korea\u2019s intensely competitive entertainment industry and the toll it takes on young performers. Promising stars are put through a gruelling training schedule as they pass along the conveyor-belt production of new girl- and boybands. Young stars are subjected to strict controls over their private lives, including bans on dating, restrictions on mobile phone use and an expectation that they will sacrifice their health to achieve the desired image. \u201cI think a day where [people] would be ashamed of the K-showbusiness will surely come,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cI think an industry that makes money by [making people] sing, dance, undergo plastic surgeries and go on a diet to please the gaze of others since they are teenagers should really go bankrupt.\u201d Sulli was 11 when she began her career as an actor, before making her K-pop debut in 2009 for f(x), who quickly became one of the country\u2019s most popular girl bands. \u201cMany celebrities who debuted at young ages suffer from depression and anxiety as they have to live in the public eye. They can be vulnerable if they get too much attention,\u201d Park Jong-seok, the head doctor at Yonsei Bom psychiatric clinic in Seoul, told the Korea Times. \u201cThey go through adolescence without experiencing genuine friendships and stability with peer groups.\u201d A number of entertainment stars have killed themselves in the last decade. Jang Ja-yeon, a popular soap star, took his own life in 2009, leaving a seven-page letter in which she claimed she had been the victim of sexual abuse and exploitation by influential politicians, business and newspaper executives and industry figures. The K-pop star Jonghyun, whose real name was Kim Jong-hyun, killed himself in December 2017; the singer and actor Goo Hara, once part of the girl band Kara, apologised to fans after being found unconscious at her home earlier this year. Kwon Ji-an, a singer and painter better known by her stage name Solbi, was subjected to cyber-insults in 2009 while a member of the K-pop group Typhoon, after being wrongly identified in a sex video that was widely shared online. Sulli\u2019s death has intensified demands for government action against bullying on popular internet portals where users are able to comment anonymously. The website of the office of the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, was flooded with demands this week that users be required to register their real names before commenting. The national assembly will reportedly begin debating a bill, already dubbed \u201cSulli\u2019s law\u201d, later this year. South Korean politicians have previously shown a willingness to tackle other forms of abuse with the enactment this year of a law against workplace bullying \u2013 known as gapjil \u2013 with persistent offenders facing a prison sentence of up to three years or a maximum fine of $25,000. The public\u2019s appetite for action against those who torment celebrities online is also growing. A poll this week by Realmeter showed support for new legislation at almost 70%. \u201cFreedom of expression is a vital value in democratic society, but insulting and hurting someone else\u2019s dignity is beyond that limit,\u201d said Lee Dong-gwi, a psychology professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cThere need to be far harsher penalties for those who violate that law.\u201d Additional reporting by Nemo Kim in Seoul In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

The latest trick employed by K-pop fans desperate to get close to band members, buying expensive airline tickets and then abruptly cancelling their flight once they have taken photos of their idols, has prompted South Korea\u2019s flagship airline to increase refund penalties for late cancellations. Korean Air announced the decision days after three fans of the boy band Wanna One took their obsession to extremes, boarding a Seoul-bound flight in Hong Kong to take photos of the band\u2019s 11 members. They then demanded that they be allowed to disembark just minutes before takeoff and that they be given a refund. \u201cThe fact is there were passengers who falsely checked in on the flight to see celebrities,\u201d a Korean Air official told Reuters. The fans, two from China and one from Hong Kong, ignored the cabin crew\u2019s requests to take their seats and forced 360 other people on board to leave the plane with their carry-on luggage and go back through security screening \u2013 a legal requirement when passengers disembark voluntarily. The incident delayed the flight last Saturday by almost an hour, Korean Air said in a statement. From January, however, the airline said it would make passengers who cancel international flights after passing through the departure gate pay an additional fine of 200,000 won ($177). Korean Air said it had dealt with 35 similar incidents in the past year, but speculated the total would rise to several hundred if other South Korean airlines were included. \u201cThere have been several cases in which fans deliberately buy expensive flight tickets that offer better rebate terms, and then demand a refund,\u201d a spokesperson for the airline told the Korea Times. \u201cHowever, as far as I know, this is the first time a group actually got on the plane and asked to leave [just] before takeoff.\u201d Buying expensive \u2013 and fully refundable \u2013 tickets gives fans access to exclusive airport facilities, increasing their chances of being able to photograph famous artists at close quarters and sell the images online, the newspaper said. Korean Air currently imposes relatively minor penalties on passengers who make last-minute cancellations. While some premium tickets can cost more than 2 million won ($1,770), no-show penalties for Korean Air services range from about 120,000 won ($105) for long-haul flights and as little as 50,000 won ($45) for shorter flights to countries such as Japan and China.

            "content": "The K-pop sensation BTS have become the first all-South Korean act to rule the top US singles chart, the industry tracker Billboard announced Monday, with their English-language Dynamite hitting No 1. It\u2019s another milestone cementing the seven-member boy band\u2019s global dominance, just hours after BTS beat US heavyweights including Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift to score the best pop award at Sunday\u2019s MTV Video Music awards. Dynamite, the first BTS single sung completely in English, was released on 21 August and tallied 33.9m US streams in just a week, with 300,000 units sold. In securing the top spot, the song unseats Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion\u2019s hit WAP, a not-safe-for-work track that held No 1 for two weeks. BTS\u2019s latest achievement comes after they reached the Billboard Hot 100\u2019s No 4 slot in March with the song On. Three BTS albums have hit No 1 on Billboard\u2019s album charts, helped in part by the mobilisation of their loyal and passionate fan community, known collectively as the BTS ARMY (Adorable Representative M.C. for Youth). But the top spot on the Hot 100 \u2013 which blends US streaming, radio airplay and digital sales data to rank the top hits \u2013 has eluded the band until now. J-Hope, Jimin, Jin, Jungkook, RM, Suga and V of BTS are the first all-South Korean group to reign over the chart. The South Korean soloist PSY reached No 2 for seven weeks in late 2012 with his viral dance juggernaut Gangnam Style. The first Asian artist to top the chart was the Japanese-born crooner Kyu Sakamoto, whose Sukiyaki held the ranking for three weeks in June 1963. K-pop \u2013 along with K-drama soap operas \u2013 has become one of South Korea\u2019s most successful cultural exports. "

            "content": "The biggest K-pop band in the world inch towards being the biggest global pop act full stop \u2013 the video for this latest single was played 45m times on YouTube in the first 24 hours of release, which is a new record. And with good reason: it is an absolute juggernaut, with a terrace chant chorus, Eurovision-level saxophone, and a surprisingly welcome return for Nicki Minaj to pop-dance beats. The group are folding ever more English language into their tracks as their star rises in the west, resulting in a dizzying bilingual hybrid. Quite simply the best track yet from Empress Of, AKA LA singer-songwriter-producer Lorely Rodriguez. Her 2015 debut album was head-turning for its sensual, impulsive pop smarts, but not all the choruses totally connected. No such problem here \u2013 the central melody is riveting: feathery and near-falsetto, it drops into a heartwrenching final line as as Rodriguez laments her disconnection from the man she\u2019s with. Shades of Jessie Ware and her regular collaborator Dev Hynes, perhaps, but outshining both with a song that already feels classic. He has never truly broken into the mainstream, seen sometimes as a mere curio or clotheshorse, but Theophilus London is a valuable MC, announcing earlier than most that rap should think bigger when it comes to genre boundaries. Everyone from Tegan and Sara\u2019s Sara Quinn and Leon Ware to Kanye West have appeared on his tracks; now he recruits Giggs for a remix of his track Bebey. The bright, funky, loping beat draws out the puckish side of his London guest, his phone blowing up as he announces his greatness and does a spot of shopping on Bond Street. Marie Davidson\u2019s voice is one of the biggest pleasures in contemporary electronic music. French-accented, often drily amused and given to rants, declarations and snatches of internal monologue, she continues the grand style of talky electro on from the likes of Miss Kittin. On So Right, the first track from forthcoming album Working Class Woman, a quiet side-of-the-dancefloor reverie (\u201cHe\u2019s got me feeling so high / man this is so nice\u201d) builds into a full house diva performance, over a classic Chicago bassline. The result is a track that essays the body high of club music and shows how close that feeling is to the erotic. It\u2019s gloriously populist, but still retains Davidson\u2019s indelible stamp; expect to hear this everywhere. A new supergroup that is quite formidable in its collective angst: Phoebe Bridgers, Julien Baker and Lucy Dacus are all experts at emotional torpor, articulated with pin-drop clarity amid moping guitars, but thankfully don\u2019t cancel each other out when they come together. Three tracks from their forthcoming EP have been released, all excellent. Stay Down is simultaneously the most morose and the most uplifting, Baker taking the lead vocal for a song of compromised romance that builds to a stunning arena-indie climax. Downbeat, understated R&B might look easy on paper \u2013 smoky vocal, minimalist drums, job done \u2013 but the patchiness of, say, the Jorja Smith album shows how tough it is to pull off. Kenzie, a Bostonian singer-songwriter now living in London, is managing it, though, with her debut tracks. Over Dark July\u2019s softly pattering breakbeat, she sings a beautiful, fragmentary summer love story with perfect huskiness, speeding from meet-cute to crying breakup in the space of a chorus. Its nagging melody is deceptively simple, but will set up shop in your brain if you\u2019re not careful. You can take comfort, in this mixed-up world, from the fact that every year there\u2019ll be a new Kurt Vile record: it won\u2019t be very different from the last, and it\u2019ll be great. On this one there is the usual bold and beautiful Neil Young-ish strumming, the glittering yet unshowy solos, and the drily amused slacker vocals. \u201cHow beautiful to take a bite out of the world,\u201d Vile muses as he kicks around his home town on the way to a long psychedelic outro. Beautiful and beguiling bedroom pop here, from rising London-based producer Jess Bartlet. The other two tracks from her Comrade EP flirt with a 4/4 techno pulse, but the title track has sweet and subtle syncopation under a glittering curtain of multitracked harp. It could have been twee in its sheer prettiness, but the jazzy sax and trumpet solos keep it cutely idiosyncratic, and Bartlet\u2019s vocal in the chorus \u2013 \u201cI\u2019ll be there when you need me\u201d \u2013 is powerful in its calm certainty. Love blokes screaming their larynxes out in near-unintelligible roars but can\u2019t get on board with the double kick-drums of straight metal nor the pomposity of the doom scene? Thou are your new favourite band. Despite being from Louisiana they dress like a group of Transylvanian vampires going to a cabaret evening, and have a great interplay between giant doom chords, stirring melodic progressions, and quite splashy, punkish drums. Elimination Rhetoric has the added bonus of an uplifting bit of soloing, segueing into a passage of joyous headbanging. \u201cI can\u2019t help myself, don\u2019t talk to me!\u201d Bryan Funck declares through his apparently rotted throat. One of the year\u2019s best and creepiest 12ins has been released: Don\u2019t DJ\u2019s All Love Affairs Fail But They Never End, a dub-techno epic that kicks off with Veles. Created by Berliner Florian Meyer, it has a tiny whisper of his earlier work with \u201cexotic\u201d sounds such as marimbas and flutes, in the subtle pan-pipe pattern on the offbeat. But that is met with absolute menace in the form of what sounds like a detuned, timestretched monastic chant. Its restless beat never quite finds its footing, and what is that scurrying and creaking at the back of the mix? This is a whole universe of glorious disquiet. "

            "content": "On Tuesday 2 June, Grammy award-winning songwriter and music artist Tiffany Red returned home from a trip to her local mall, where she had encountered the national guard armed with large rifles, an experience that left Red \u201ctraumatized\u201d. Exactly one week before, George Floyd had been killed in Minneapolis, and tensions in the country were rising as hundreds of thousands took to the streets in protest. Tuesday 2 June was also #BlackoutTuesday, a global \u201csocial media moment\u201d that grew out of the music industry\u2019s #TheShowMustBePaused, an initiative created to \u201chold the industry at large\u201d \u2013 including major corporations and their partners who benefit from the efforts, struggles and successes of Black people \u2013 accountable. Still processing her experience at the mall earlier that day, Red opened her inbox to find a message from her South Korean music publisher, Ekko Music Rights, regarding a $66 payment for a song she had written for one of K-pop\u2019s most popular groups, NCT Dream \u2013 a straightforward business transaction with zero acknowledgment of what Red, a Black American woman, may have been going through given the news cycle then. For Red, who has worked with artists such as Zendaya, Jennifer Hudson and Jason Derulo, this was a final straw. She had already decided to stop writing K-pop music because she felt she was poorly compensated, but Ekko\u2019s aloofness spoke to a continued concern she harbored about the industry at large: that despite K-pop\u2019s reliance on Black music and culture, the industry didn\u2019t actually support Black lives. Today, a striking number of K-pop hits are written and produced by Black Americans and a significant percentage of K-pop fans in the US are Black. As K-pop grows in popularity worldwide, many international fans are waiting for the industry to develop a more sensitive, globalized understanding of race. Within K-pop, blackface, mouthing or saying racial slurs, and purely aesthetic uses of Black culture and hairstyles are still common. In recent weeks, as the media has painted K-pop fans as politically active and engaged for overwhelming racist hashtags with videos of their favorite acts and reserving thousands of tickets to artificially boost expected attendance at Donald Trump\u2019s Tulsa rally, official statements of support for Black lives have trickled in from a handful of groups and idols. Arguably the most well-known K-pop group in the world, BTS, and their parent company, Big Hit Entertainment (whose CEO has stated publicly that \u201cBlack music is the base\u201d of the septet\u2019s musical identity), were some of the most vocal, and the only group to donate money \u2013 $1m \u2013 to Black Lives Matter. But many contend that the industry overall has failed to show unified support for the movement. Now, Black creatives and fans are holding them accountable. SM Entertainment is one of South Korea\u2019s three largest entertainment companies. It is credited with producing the first K-pop idol group, H.O.T., in 1996, which established the \u201cSM performance\u201d style that the brand still employs today: a combination of impressive visuals, dance, rock, rap and hip-hop that took inspiration from Black American artists of the MTV generation. Songwriter and producer Micah Powell attended six SM songwriting camps between 2015 and 2018. At one camp, he wrote a song called Devil and created a dance move to go with it, which he then showed to SM executives. \u201cThe entire staff lit up,\u201d Powell says of their reaction. Devil became the lead single of SM group Super Junior\u2019s 2015 album of the same name. When Powell watched the music video for Devil for the first time, he was shocked to see that his dance move, a hip tap and high clap combination, had been used as part of the song\u2019s chorus, without his permission, and without credit or compensation. Powell\u2019s background vocals on the track had also been used without payment or credit. \u201cI had to hunt [SM] down,\u201d he says, and was eventually paid $200 for the vocals which he had recorded in Korean, a language he does not speak. Powell says the industry\u2019s lack of action is \u201ca microcosm of a bigger issue, part of a bigger puzzle of inequality\u201d. K-pop looks to the west for inspiration and \u201cthis is exactly how white people see us. They use our culture, they love our culture, they\u2019ll take everything from our culture, but don\u2019t pour back into our culture.\u201d More than two weeks after Red posted her frustrations with the industry on Instagram, SM Entertainment, the \u201csister company\u201d of Ekko Music Rights, released a statement that read: \u201cWe stand with our Black collaborators, friends and fans\u201d and added that \u201cwe are new to this conversation\u201d. Red\u2019s frustration is palpable as she scoffs at this: \u201cYou aren\u2019t new to this conversation, you are a part of this conversation. We are the people who make your music. Why would you ever think that you\u2019re excluded from this?\u201d \u201cI am Black before I am a K-pop stan,\u201d says Ellie, 19, who prefers to use her first name to avoid the harassment some K-pop fans face when they speak out against popular groups, \u201cand when I was first discovering NCT 127, the Limitless video really offended me.\u201d Limitless, a 2017 single from the SM group NCT 127, was produced and composed by a handful of successful Black American producers. In the song\u2019s music video, the company styled some members of the group in hairstyles typically worn by Black men and accessorized them in clothing that directly referenced Black hip-hop artists. Ellie notes that while styling like this is what\u2019s been deemed \u201cunique and fresh\u201d within the industry, it\u2019s \u201call been seen before within the Black community\u201d. She is a huge supporter of NCT 127 and has slept on the street three times to see them in person during appearances in New York City. She also danced with the group when they made a surprise appearance last year in Washington Square Park. In 2019, NCT 127 reportedly made over $24m touring in US arenas, many filled with Black fans (maybe as much as 18% according to a recent fan poll). And yet the group and SM itself \u201crarely ever show any remorse when they offend [those] fans by culturally appropriating, and continue to misstep\u201d, says Ellie, most recently by styling an NCT 127 member in a Lynyrd Skynyrd T-shirt with the Confederate flag on it for a music video. Fans of NCT 127, or \u201cNCTzens\u201d, have tried to call attention to these concerns through organized outreach to SM but \u201cdespite being emailed, tweeted at and called out [the company] continues to harm Black fans\u201d with their choices, Ellie says. K-pop fan Davonna Gilpin, 27, who lives in Los Angeles, has been following Korean music for 12 years and hosts a pop culture podcast called Melanetizens with a fellow Black K-pop fan. She says that this is an industry-wide problem. \u201cI\u2019ve noticed during my time [as a fan that] the concerns of others are almost always acknowledged, but not the concerns of Black people.\u201d For example, YG Entertainment recently edited out a depiction of the Hindu god Ganesha from a Blackpink music video because it had been deemed offensive by many Hindu fans. Just last month, SM publicly apologized for styling that included a pin with a Japanese slur. Within days of receiving complaints, the company not only delayed the release of a music video but also issued a reprint of the entire album so that the pins could be digitally removed. And yet, Gilpin notes, the Confederate flag remains visible to the public. Given that, \u201cI can\u2019t help but think they\u2019ve seen all the concerns and critiques and choose to ignore it,\u201d she concludes. After seeing Red\u2019s Instagram posts, Ellie, Gilpin, and fellow fan De\u2019Andra Johnson, 23, who lives in Inglewood, California, organized #SMBlackout, a hashtag event \u201cto bring awareness to the importance of Black fans and Black creatives in SM\u2019s roster\u201d. Gilpin says: \u201cI\u2019ve skipped lunch to save up to go to multiple NCT 127 tour stops and buy albums and merch. So on top of how disrespectful it was [for SM] to not speak up for their Black employees and collaborators, I felt it was also disrespectful to their Black consumers. If Black lives don\u2019t matter to them then Black dollars, Black music and Black fashion and style shouldn\u2019t either.\u201d One week after the #SMBlackout event, SM released its official statement. Ellie says those six sentences, which were only posted in English and did not lay out a plan of action, \u201cdid not hold any weight\u201d. Gilpin adds: \u201cI was confused by the \u2018we\u2019re new to this conversation\u2019 part because we\u2019ve been trying to have this conversation with them for years and they decided they didn\u2019t want to listen.\u201d She says that if they are truly interested in creating change, \u201cnow is the best time for them to come forward and actively participate, especially since the industry has been moving into a huge global spotlight. To me, it\u2019s not a political or controversial stance. It should be a no-brainer for anyone, any company, any industry to stand for human rights and equality.\u201d Johnson notes that she is still waiting for statements from YG and Pledis, which produce a handful of chart-topping groups she also likes. Other K-pop fans are waiting on action from the companies that manage their favorite acts, including JYP, whose CEO has incorporated blackface into his performances as a solo artist and also named practice rooms at the company facilities after Black artists he admires. For Red, this moment is the beginning of a new personal mission: to bring change to the music industry through activism. \u201cIt\u2019s needed, it\u2019s missing. There\u2019s no one protecting the artists and there\u2019s so much to protect us from,\u201d she says. She will continue producing her solo music at home in Los Angeles, but doesn\u2019t have any intention of writing for others any longer. \u201cI\u2019d love to see what would happen to K-pop if we all stopped [writing for the industry],\u201d Red says. \u201cI would be a liar if I didn\u2019t say that I didn\u2019t participate in helping them steal our culture. We didn\u2019t make the system, but it\u2019s all of our responsibility to fix it to make it better. Black people are not the only people who will benefit from that system changing in K-pop. Everyone will benefit from that. It\u2019ll create a whole new system of accountability.\u201d "

            "title": "K-pop under scrutiny over 'toxic fandom' after death of Sulli",
            "content": "The death this week of the South Korean singer and actor Sulli has turned the spotlight on the darkest corners of the highly pressurised K-pop industry and sparked anger over the failure of management agencies to protect their stars from the menace of \u201ctoxic fandom\u201d. Sulli, a former member of the group f(x), had spoken publicly about her mental health problems and shock at her death has led to calls for greater support for performers. Authorities said she was suffering from severe depression and are investigating suicide as a possible cause of death. Sulli, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri, was one of a growing number of female South Korean singers and actors to have been targeted by online vitriol, often from anonymous male fans enraged by their idols\u2019 refusal to conform to social norms. Her \u201ccrimes\u201d had included live-streaming a drinking session with friends and her decision not to wear a bra in public. She also revealed that she was in a relationship at the zenith of her singing career, defying the industry\u2019s carefully crafted image of young female stars as sexually desirable but inexperienced. She smashed other taboos, too, hosting a TV series about how online abuse had contributed to her anxiety disorder and social phobia, in a country with a strong cultural resistance to discussing mental illness. \u201cShe expressed her views about what was intrinsically wrong in our society about how female stars are supposed to behave,\u201d said Prof Yunkim Ji-yeong, an expert on Korean gender issues at the Institute of Body and Culture at Konkuk University in Seoul. The messages of sympathy that flooded the internet after news of Sulli\u2019s death emerged on Monday also criticised the culture of South Korea\u2019s intensely competitive entertainment industry and the toll it takes on young performers. Promising stars are put through a gruelling training schedule as they pass along the conveyor-belt production of new girl- and boybands. Young stars are subjected to strict controls over their private lives, including bans on dating, restrictions on mobile phone use and an expectation that they will sacrifice their health to achieve the desired image. \u201cI think a day where [people] would be ashamed of the K-showbusiness will surely come,\u201d one user wrote. \u201cI think an industry that makes money by [making people] sing, dance, undergo plastic surgeries and go on a diet to please the gaze of others since they are teenagers should really go bankrupt.\u201d Sulli was 11 when she began her career as an actor, before making her K-pop debut in 2009 for f(x), who quickly became one of the country\u2019s most popular girl bands. \u201cMany celebrities who debuted at young ages suffer from depression and anxiety as they have to live in the public eye. They can be vulnerable if they get too much attention,\u201d Park Jong-seok, the head doctor at Yonsei Bom psychiatric clinic in Seoul, told the Korea Times. \u201cThey go through adolescence without experiencing genuine friendships and stability with peer groups.\u201d A number of entertainment stars have killed themselves in the last decade. Jang Ja-yeon, a popular soap star, took his own life in 2009, leaving a seven-page letter in which she claimed she had been the victim of sexual abuse and exploitation by influential politicians, business and newspaper executives and industry figures. The K-pop star Jonghyun, whose real name was Kim Jong-hyun, killed himself in December 2017; the singer and actor Goo Hara, once part of the girl band Kara, apologised to fans after being found unconscious at her home earlier this year. Kwon Ji-an, a singer and painter better known by her stage name Solbi, was subjected to cyber-insults in 2009 while a member of the K-pop group Typhoon, after being wrongly identified in a sex video that was widely shared online. Sulli\u2019s death has intensified demands for government action against bullying on popular internet portals where users are able to comment anonymously. The website of the office of the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, was flooded with demands this week that users be required to register their real names before commenting. The national assembly will reportedly begin debating a bill, already dubbed \u201cSulli\u2019s law\u201d, later this year. South Korean politicians have previously shown a willingness to tackle other forms of abuse with the enactment this year of a law against workplace bullying \u2013 known as gapjil \u2013 with persistent offenders facing a prison sentence of up to three years or a maximum fine of $25,000. The public\u2019s appetite for action against those who torment celebrities online is also growing. A poll this week by Realmeter showed support for new legislation at almost 70%. \u201cFreedom of expression is a vital value in democratic society, but insulting and hurting someone else\u2019s dignity is beyond that limit,\u201d said Lee Dong-gwi, a psychology professor at Yonsei University in Seoul. \u201cThere need to be far harsher penalties for those who violate that law.\u201d Additional reporting by Nemo Kim in Seoul In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.

            "title": "Pubs, K-pop and Wilfred Owen: Baltic Artists\u2019 award 2019 review",
            "content": "As Iraq war veteran Aaron Hughes contemplates his new commission for the Baltic Artists\u2019 award, he tells the Guardian that \u201ccreativity can push back against the divisions that drive conflict\u201d. Deployed to Iraq on behalf of the US army in 2003-04, Hughes became disillusioned by the destruction of war, and chose to turn his hand to creativity. His work now hangs in the Baltic alongside pieces by Ingrid Pollard and Kang Jungsuck. All three have been awarded the 2019 Baltic Artists\u2019 award, which began in 2017. The venue says it\u2019s the only visual art prize to be judged exclusively by established artists \u2013 in this case Lubaina Himid, Michael Rakowitz and Haegue Yang \u2013 who were each asked to select a new artist whose work they find compelling. This year\u2019s artists all utilise creativity in order to \u201cpush back against\u201d divisions: Hughes in detailing the collective trauma of war, Pollard in her quest to address racial discrimination and Jungsuck as he blurs the boundaries of real and imagined worlds. The exhibition opens with Pollard\u2019s exploration of the representation of the black figure in British life. Her series of photographs, pub signs, prints and paraphernalia has been created and collected over 25 years. The title, Seventeen of Sixty Eight, relates to the 68 pubs in the UK that have \u201cBlack Boy\u201d in their name. Paired with other objects such as a \u201cBlack Boy\u201d tavern coin (used in exchange for a pint), a figurine holding a menu blackboard and a video of a black puppet dancing, the photographs create an unsettling narrative where black figures are exoticised or seen as \u201cother\u201d. Pollard, chosen by Himid, is concerned with how we move through the space. She wants us to squint, to stand back, bend down, look upwards. In reconfiguring our physical stance, we are forced to consider afresh these familiar objects. Jungsuck, chosen by Yang, is also interested in space \u2013 so much so he used a gaming platform to create a VR version of the Baltic\u2019s gallery to build his installation digitally. On stepping into the Korean artist\u2019s exhibition, we also step into the imagined game world he dreamed up on his headset, with platforms, structural shapes and characters. Three video screens depict the players; an animated K-pop star, a self-driving car and us, the humans. A short conversation with Jungsuck reveals layers of meaning and innovative thought, but without an artist guide these ideas are not that transparent. There is a sculpture, referred to as a painting, which is based on an old type of gaming controller and which is also, inexplicably, a map of Gateshead. To determine why requires another stretch of the imagination. Hughes takes the final room, combining music, printmaking and poetry to ensure death is not the only outcome of war. He transforms Wilfred Owen\u2019s nine poems from Britten\u2019s The War Requiem into large woodblock prints. The sharp contrast between the black and white ink creates a level of abstraction in which shapes become indecipherable; bodies disappear under white-capped waves, lifeless men swing by their necks from a suspension bridge, the eyes of homeless people stare out. In collaboration with various Iraqi and war veteran poets, local groups and Karim Wasfi (the former conductor of the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra), Hughes adds a layer of sound to the silent motifs: we hear Owen\u2019s poems reimagined and the cello of Wasfi, who played his instrument at the bombsites of Baghdad.  If the Baltic Artists\u2019 award is a litmus, the future for the visual arts looks set to be probing, challenging, generous, compassionate and hi-tech. It\u2019s easy to see why Pollard, Hughes and Jungsuck were chosen. In each of their new commissions they invoke a set of fully formed ideas, employing a variety of media to interrogate how we live today. Baltic Artists\u2019 award 2019 is at the Baltic, Gateshead until 16 June. "

            "title": "South Korea under pressure to crack down on cyberbullying after high-profile deaths",
            "content": "South Korea\u2019s government is under mounting pressure to crack down on cyberbullying after the apparent suicides of an athlete and YouTube influencer who were relentlessly abused online. Kim In-hyeok, a professional volleyball player, was found dead at his home in Suwon, last week, a day before the death of Cho Jang-mi, a popular live streamer better known as BJ Jammi. Kim had received a barrage of hateful comments over his appearance and speculation about his sexual identity. The 27-year-old, who played for Daejeon Samsung Fire Bluefangs, reportedly left a note that contained \u201cpessimistic\u201d reflections on his life, according to South Korea\u2019s Yonhap news agency. Cho, a YouTube influencer who also had a huge following on the game-streaming platform Twitch, had been suffering from depression following more than two years of sexually derogatory comments and claims that she hated men, according to a social media post by a member of her family. Her death triggered calls for strong punishments against fellow YouTubers and commentators who posted rumours and hateful comments directed at Cho, who was 27. A petition on the website of the presidential Blue House had attracted more than 150,000 signatures by Tuesday. Although the global reach of South Korean pop culture is often a cause for celebration, at home, the combination of celebrity obsession and high rates of digital connectivity has been blamed for a number of celebrity suicides in recent years. The suicide in 2019 of the singer and actor Sulli sparked anger over the failure of management agencies to protect their stars from \u201ctoxic fandom\u201d and demands for government action against bullying on popular internet portals where users were able to comment anonymously. Her death prompted web portals Naver and Daum to close comments sections for sports and entertainment stories, but online abuse remains a problem on social media sites such as YouTube and Instagram. \u201cMore people are suffering depression and mental difficulties because of online hate speech. It is a problem that can destroy a person\u2019s life,\u201d Kim Tae-yeon, a lawyer specialising in defamation and cyberbullying cases, told Yonhap. Cyberbullies who once abused victims on South Korean sites have simply turned to global social media platforms, knowing that they will be harder to identify. As a result, police have struggled to bring prosecutions, despite a rise in the number of reported cases. \u201cEven if offenders are caught, they usually end up with light penalties such as fines,\u201d Kim said. Kim In-hyeok had publicly complained about the online abuse he received and addressed speculation about his sexuality and use of cosmetics. \u201cI have never worn makeup, I don\u2019t like guys, I had a girlfriend and I never appeared on an adult film,\u201d he posted on his Instagram account last August. \u201cPeople who have no idea who I really am send countless direct messages and post spiteful comments whenever I play a game. It\u2019s really hard to bear all that. Please stop.\u201d In 2019, Cho was accused of making a gesture in one of her videos that indicated she hated men. Her mother, who monitored online comments directed at her daughter, committed suicide soon after, according to reports. "

            "title": "K-pop stars to perform in North Korea for first time since 2005",
            "content": " South Korea has said it will send K-pop singers to perform in North Korea for the first time in more than a decade. More than 150 artists, including K-pop stars, are to visit Pyongyang from 31 March, Seoul said on Tuesday, in what will be a reciprocal visit after North Korea sent performers to the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics.  The visit, which was agreed after talks between the countries in the border area of Panmunjom and will include a series of concerts, will last until 3 April, South Korea\u2019s unification ministry said.  The group will include the K-pop girl group Red Velvet and the veteran singers Cho Yong-pil and Lee Sun-hee, the ministry said.  Cho was the most recent South Korean singer to perform in North Korea, at a concert in Pyongyang in 2005.  The singer and record producer Yoon Sang, who led South Korea\u2019s delegation at the talks on Tuesday, said: \u201cWhile we\u2019re on the stage, I believe it will be difficult to portray personal feelings towards denuclearisation.  \u201cOur first task will be to instil the same awe in North Korean audiences as we do our South Korean ones, and make sure nothing is awkward.\u201d  Further negotiations, such as deciding the songs to be performed, will not be done face to face, he said.  The visiting group will perform two shows in Pyongyang, one at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre, which hosted a landmark performance by the New York Philharmonic in 2008.  The other show will be held at the Ryugyong Chung Ju-yung Gymnasium, a joint project between North and South Korea named after the Hyundai founder, Chung Ju-yung.  Officials will visit North Korea from 22 to 24 March to inspect the sites and ensure they can accommodate the singers, the ministry said.  The arrangement is the latest example of the detente that has been achieved this year, in which Pyongyang participated in the Winter Olympics and has since agreed to hold direct talks with the US.  "

            "title": "Ddu-du you know? English is losing its grip as the language of pop",
            "content": "A band has attained a certain stature when its \u201cworld tour\u201d consists of an imperial sweep through four continents, with just half a dozen concerts in each. The South Korea-based girl group Blackpink are currently midway through just such a jaunt \u2013 next month, they arrive in Europe to play six dates (London and Manchester included). Remarkably, this high-visibility procession is the first time the K-pop quartet have toured outside Korea or Japan; more remarkable still, they\u2019ve released just one album and a scant handful of tracks \u2013 and while they\u2019ve made English-language videos, most of their material is in Korean or Japanese. Nonetheless, they\u2019re adored by a worldwide fanbase, for whom language is no barrier. Recent industry figures underline the strength of the global music market, with some suggesting the place of the English language at the forefront of pop is diminishing. Blackpink, whose most streamed single, Ddu-du Ddu-du, has had 735m views on YouTube, are the latest manifestation of what is looking like a baseline change in how pop is conveyed. Until recently, English was its lingua franca, and to sing in any other language relegated an artist to the second tier, successful only in their own region, unless they had a rare border-crossing novelty hit. But in 2018 a bubbling linguistic pot came to the boil when worldwide breakthroughs by the K-pop boybands BTS and Monsta X, and Spanish-speaking rapper/singers J Balvin, Ozuna and Bad Bunny, all of whom make a point of performing in their own languages, upended convention. Blackpink\u2019s album became the first by a female K-pop group to reach America\u2019s top 40 chart, and the most streamed song globally of 2018\u2019s last quarter was DJ Snake\u2019s Spanish-language Taki Taki. The idea that the public would listen only if they understood the lyrics? Wrong, it turned out. What\u2019s more important is the feel of the tune as it spills out of a smartphone, not to mention the relatability of the artist (Ddu-du Ddu-du, for instance, asserts that Blackpink are \u201cpretty and savage\u201d, and if you\u2019re a 13-year-old Blink \u2013 as fans call themselves \u2013 what\u2019s not to love?). Even without the boost provided by the 40 million Americans who speak Spanish as their first language, Colombian Balvin and Puerto Ricans Ozuna and Bad Bunny would likely have made headway in the US by dint of releasing consistently exciting music. (Though Balvin has been spreading himself thin, collaborating with the likes of Liam Payne and David Guetta on tracks that are more marriages of brands than musical love matches.) And India\u2019s huge industry could be the next to see its artists claim new territory, writes Tim Ingham of Music Business Worldwide: \u201cSpotify is expected to launch in the territory in the coming weeks, with a heavy focus on striking up relationships with local artists. The firm recently inked a global content licensing deal with India\u2019s biggest label, T-Series, which also happens to be the owner of the world\u2019s second largest YouTube channel, with over 60.5 billion plays of its videos to date.\u201d So, it\u2019s farewell, then \u2013 maybe \u2013 to English as pop\u2019s primary force. Perhaps it was inevitable: there are 7.5 billion people in the world, and only 5% \u2013 360 million \u2013 are native Anglophones, meaning that it has ben punching far above its weight. The globalisation of pop feels, as do so many current cultural shifts, like a necessary redressing of the balance, and not an unwelcome one: having reviewed sold-out London shows by BTS and Monsta X last year, I can verify that you don\u2019t need to understand Korean to get it. (It helps that their music, and that of Blackpink, is an instantly recognisable tumult of electronic pop with rappy bits \u2013 the musica franca of every teenager in the world.) And yet \u2026 not so fast. In listening to music, there are times when, for English speakers, only English will do. Its rhythms and intonations suit particular genres, notably rock and the singer-songwriter strand of indie, where wordplay and apt turns of phrase often crop up. There\u2019s no real substitute, especially in gloomy moments, for listening to some familiar song and feeling that the songwriter knew exactly how you felt when they wrote those twisty little couplets. English might be ceding some of its supremacy, but the music business\u2019s centre of gravity is still the US and the UK, and Anglophone musicians won\u2019t be turfed out of a job for a while yet.

            "content": "K-pop boy band BTS swept the American Music Awards last month, making history as the first Asian act to win artist of the year; they were also nominated for a Grammy for best pop duo/group performance for their single Butter. The seven-member band has a huge global following and their fans, known as Army, are known for their passion and loyalty. Here Guardian readers, who are BTS fans, speak about why the band means so much to them.  I was struggling with adjusting to life with a toddler and a newborn; exhausted and feeling insecure. Finding BTS gave me energy on sleepless nights, comfort during isolation, and confidence when I felt like I wasn\u2019t good enough. During a cycle of depression and anxiety, I felt like I was wasting my life. One day, while I was using a free moment of nap time to scrub the kitchen, I started to panic. Paradise began playing from a BTS playlist and the melody and tone of the song touched me instantly. I stopped in my tracks to find the lyrics, and the words to that song were exactly what I needed to hear that day. \u201cIt\u2019s alright to stop / There\u2019s no need to run without even knowing the reason / It\u2019s alright to not have a dream / If you have moments where you feel happiness for a while.\u201d After reading those lyrics, a weight seemed to lift from my heart. I didn\u2019t need to exhaust myself trying to prove my worth. I didn\u2019t need to find a corporate ladder to climb or build a brand in order to feel happy. All I really wanted was a simple, comfortable life so my kids have a solid foundation. BTS taught me that I am enough; that I am worthy just by being myself. I think what sets BTS apart from other artists is their friendship. They are the definition of friendship goals. Their love and respect for each other is at the core of everything they do and it shows fans what genuine love and friendship looks like. During this pandemic, I\u2019ve found comfort in watching the members comfort each other. Ashley Briggs, 36, full-time parent and podcast producer/writer, Tucson, Arizona, US What sets BTS apart from other bands is their pride in being Korean. As an Asian, I find this inspiring. I was born in Sweden to two Vietnamese immigrants so the insecurities over my heritage have always been lingering in the back of my head. I adapted a western name because I didn\u2019t want to be the odd one out. But BTS have normalised hard to pronounce names.  They proudly speak Korean during important award speeches (like their UN speech), wear hanbok (traditional Korean dress) and promote Korean culture. BTS represents those of us who had awkward lunch boxes at school, those of us who didn\u2019t want to speak our parents language in public.  BTS made me realise that my failures do not define who I am. I\u2019ve never been vocal about my emotions so for me to have seven people who sing exactly what I feel truly helps me understand myself and find new ways to evolve. BTS inspires me to love myself without feeling ashamed. Stephanie Le, 28, paralegal, Stockholm, Sweden When I was at my lowest last year, staring at my own mortality after a heart attack, they came to the rescue. The message of loving yourself that pervades most of their music was what I needed to hear. To believe that despite my small, nothing-special accomplishments in life, I was still a worthy person \u2013 that was a revelation to me. They helped with my perception of myself as an invisible older woman. It seems minor, but my style has changed. I\u2019m more confident in choosing a youthful style instead of safe, neutral clothes, and wearing makeup more often. They make me feel young. Their humility and respect for all people, the politeness they always show was a lesson as well. It\u2019s too easy at my age to think you\u2019ve seen it all and have all the answers but nothing could be more wrong. I\u2019m more open and accepting than I used to be but still have a long way to go. Critical care nurses often say that dying patients rarely talk about the money or possessions they had but wish they had given more of their time to experiences, like falling in love, the birth of a child, travelling, escapades with their friends, etc. I know the BTS concert on 1 December will be one of the top experiences I\u2019ll be reviewing on my deathbed. Sharman, 68, retired, Canada There\u2019s a saying within Army that \u201cyou find BTS when you need them most\u201d. Although I started hearing about them in 2016, I had never played their music because I had this impression that all K-pop music sounded the same: noisy EDM sounds, unstructured rap etc. I was gladly proven wrong when the Love Yourself album was released. At that time in my life, I had many new thoughts, emotions, and feelings that scared me because I couldn\u2019t define them. I was unable to share my thoughts or feelings with anyone because I was unable to describe them or to find the words. BTS did that for me. Anonymous, 25, Agadir, Morocco I\u2019m particularly fond of rap music and once my wife introduced me to BTS and I heard Cypher 4, I was won over. Their rapping and storytelling is next level. I\u2019m a big dude with a beard and tattoos and people often think I\u2019m a metal head. Whilst that is true, I love K-pop so much. The shows are a whole vibe, the music, the dancing, the theatrics and the fan engagement. It has everything that I feel Western music and artists lack. I think the reason BTS stands out to me so much is because of their genre-bending music. So much goes into their instrumentals that it\u2019s easy for anyone to find something they like. Lyrically, their messages of self-love are very powerful and genuine. You can tell they\u2019re not just singing them for the sake of it, you know? Rob, 27, works in insurance, Liverpool, Australia I became a fan when I heard their song Dynamite on a Spotify 2010s playlist in June this year. I was demotivated with work and felt isolated during the pandemic. Dynamite sounded like pure happiness encapsulated in a song. I was searching for non-English songs or other new upbeat songs to add to my work from home playlist. It was my first time hearing BTS or K-pop; I was surprised that Dynamite was in English and sounded like a Bruno Mars song. I ended up going on a five-hour BTS deep dive right after that. I love that they are Korean and fellow Asians; it\u2019s relevant that they\u2019re not from the West. Not only are they super talented and professional, they obviously love what they do, love being around each other, and they\u2019re loyal to their fans. Despite their global success, they continue to be as hardworking, genuine, grounded, humble, and hilarious as when they started. They\u2019ve been closely involved in the songwriting and production of their records from the start, and explore compelling themes in their songs. Also, we all love an underdog story that ends well, and BTS is one such story. Bernice Roldan, 42, gender consultant for a multilateral development bank, Manila, Philippines When the Atlanta shootings made headlines earlier this year, I realised that as an adult, I still had a lot of unresolved racial trauma. As a Korean-American who grew up in a predominantly white suburb of Chicago, I was always embarrassed about being different. I became a fan of BTS with the intention of acknowledging the shame I used to carry and to heal my broken relationship with my cultural identity. I love their music, performances, and personalities, but BTS\u2019 breakthrough into mainstream media means so much more to me \u2013 it helps me believe that voices like mine matter and deserve to be heard.Ashley Cho, 30, school counselor, Seattle, Washington, US I had a childhood friend who passed away when I was in middle school, and I could never come to terms with the situation. I had my emotions bottled up. After hearing BTS\u2019s Spring Day, I broke down and cried hard for a long time and realised that I missed them more than I imagined. The lyrics, \u201cbogo sipda\u201d (I miss you) being repeated over and over again drew out these emotions that I kept hidden for a long time. So, I\u2019m grateful BTS gave me the opportunity to say my final goodbye. Theresa Frimpong, 21, medical student, Ghana The first time I came across BTS was in 2018, when they were on the Graham Norton Show. The turning point for me was when I heard them talk for the first time in the United Nations in 2018. The Love Yourself, Speak Yourself campaign really resonated with me, as did their Map of the Soul era that delved deeper to our personas. Their music and messaging gave me hope to fight my own inner demons and love myself. I\u2019m a 31-year-old straight male who\u2019s engaged. To some people, I\u2019m not your typical fan of BTS. Everyone expects that boy bands only have screaming teenage girls as their fans but that is simply not true. I just wish that everyone understood that BTS actually has probably the most diverse fan base in the world. Eero Aleinikov, 31, Finland As a young Asian American, I was lucky growing up in an inclusive suburb, where although known to be predominantly Caucasian, all blends of cultures and ethnicities were embodied in the school populations. That said, the \u201cK-wave\u201d had not reached the depths of Naperville yet, and I remember K-pop lovers being perceived as outcasts all over the States. As the pandemic hit and schools went on a break, I took a considerable amount of time, reflecting on my stressors, and learning how to value and love myself. This is when I became a BTS fan. I realised how the Army community carries a similar message as the members they stan. The countless friends I made and folks that reached out to send content, fangirl with, and later support my news account were so heartwarming, especially at a time where I needed the laughs and comfort. Zee S, 19, pre-med student, Naperville Illinois, US  BTS gave my daughter and I a commonality that made it easier to navigate through that mother-teen daughter relationship. Now she is the founding member of our high school\u2019s K-pop club and I\u2019m the advisor. We\u2019ve created a safe space that is so diverse but eclectic. There is a dance committee, a committee that focuses on the arts, and even one for conversations about cultural appropriation. Their music was so powerful and uplifting and real. These seven young men are speaking to the world in a universal language that came right on time. How could I not appreciate that? What makes BTS stand out is their willingness to be vulnerable. Yes, they work hard but they also aren\u2019t afraid to mess up and own up to it. They let the world know when they need a break from it all and come back stronger. You can always find a BTS song that explains how you feel even when you can\u2019t figure it out. NaShonda, 46, educator, Raleigh, North Carolina, US "

            "content": "Is celebrity merchandise the new Monet? Auction houses are in flux, with more and more pop culture items being sold under the hammer for six and seven-figure sums. Last month, Julien\u2019s Auctions in Beverly Hills hosted a three-day auction of Janet Jackson\u2019s personal belongings, including some of her most iconic stage outfits. Buyers included Kim Kardashian, who snagged Jackson\u2019s outfit from the music video for her 1993 classic If for $25,000 (\u00a318,000) and, on Instagram, said she was \u201csuch a fan\u201d of the singer. \u201cA collector recently told me: \u2018It\u2019s cooler to hang John Lennon\u2019s guitar on my wall than a Monet or Picasso,\u2019\u201d says Darren Julien, the owner of Julien\u2019s, the only auction house that trades exclusively in celebrity items, explaining how 20th-century pop culture artefacts have become the new classic paintings, thanks to a generation of monied millennials. Although Christie\u2019s started its rock and pop memorabilia section in the 80s, Julien\u2019s, which began in 2003, was the first auction house to deal exclusively in pop culture items. Early auctions included the dress in which Marilyn Monroe sang Happy Birthday to President John F Kennedy (sold for $4.8m in 2016) and the moss-green cardigan Kurt Cobain wore for Nirvana\u2019s MTV Unplugged performance (sold once in 2015 for $140,800 and again in 2019 for $334,000). The Unplugged guitar went for more last year. \u201cAfter we sold Kurt Cobain\u2019s guitar for over $6m last year, we had buyers want the cardigan that we sold for $334,000,\u201d says Julien. \u201cThe sale of the guitar made $334,000 seem cheap. We had one client who offered over $600,000 to buy [the cardigan] from the winning bidder, but the buyer in our 2019 auction declined to sell it.\u201d Julien says that the shift from antiques and classic portraits to memorabilia was a long time coming. \u201cWhen I started working with Sotheby\u2019s in 1999, collectibles was almost looked down upon as something for fans only,\u201d he says. \u201cIts been slowly shifting.\u201d There has also been a rise in auctions of items still owned by the relevant celebrities, as opposed to property from fan collections. So items under the hammer may well owe their cachet to celebrities who are still alive and performing. \u201cI remember, when I was trying to talk Cher into doing the auction nearly 15 years ago, she said: \u2018[But] I\u2019m not dead,\u2019\u201d Julien recalls. \ud83d\ude31 | Kim Kardashian informou pelo seu instagram que comprou o figurino usado por Janet Jackson no videoclipe da m\u00fasica \"if\" no leil\u00e3o que ocorreu neste final de semana. - JJBRA quer saber, comprariam?! pic.twitter.com/zcBFtJynq2 \u201c[Those auctions] showed celebrities and this market that you don\u2019t have to be dead to have a successful auction of your belongings,\u201d he says, mentioning a Barbra Streisand auction in 2009. \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed that items are still selling for big money, even though the celebrity is still alive.\u201d The house went on to have similar auctions for Ringo Starr, Nancy Sinatra and Bette Midler. Julien says that hosting auctions for top celebrities makes it easier for others to jump in and have one themselves. \u201cJanet Jackson was one of the most difficult people to talk into an auction because she\u2019s so private,\u201d he says. \u201cEven Janet was surprised at the results and she really got into the process of not only creating an amazing video for her fans to see in her box set but surprising the fans on the day of her birthday, coming on the screens in the auction room to thank them for attending.\u201d In January, Julien\u2019s auctioned seven outfits from K-pop boyband BTS. The costumes from their 2020 video for Dynamite sold for $162,500, far above the $40,000 estimate. Does Julien think selling off items by relatively new pop culture figures is the future trend? \u201cYes, especially if it\u2019s a band or someone as hugely popular as BTS,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you take a set of outfits that are worth $2,000 and put them on BTS, have them perform in them in a music video and then the song is nominated for a Grammy, you just increased the value of those outfits 81 times.\u201d Next month, artefacts being sold will include Bob Dylan\u2019s handwritten lyrics to Lay, Lady, Lay; a handwritten letter by Britney Spears that she sent to a school boyfriend; and a scrawly self portrait by Cobain. \u201cThese lifestyle auctions have now become a way for celebrities to do something that helps build their legacy,\u201d Julien says. \u201cMany of these items belong in museums or in the hands of people who can properly preserve them, and it also takes the pressure off storing so many items for celebrities.\u201d "

            "title": "How BTS became the world's biggest boyband",
            "content": "BTS arrive for their first ever UK shows by private jet. They have been using it on the US leg of their world tour, which culminated in a show to 40,000 people at New York\u2019s Citi Field on 6 October, three days before playing to as many people again across two nights at the O2 Arena in London. They have racked up two US No 1 albums and billions of global streams, and were recently invited to the UN as Unicef ambassadors, where their charismatic leader, RM, made a speech, in English, on self-acceptance. Milestones such as these are monumental for any artist, but in reaching them BTS \u2013 rappers Suga, RM and J-hope and vocalists Jimin, V, Jin and Jungkook \u2013 have changed the face of pop, as the first Korean group to reach the upper echelons of the western music industry. Ethereal-looking Jimin broke down at the end of the Citi Field show. The band have played similar-sized shows in other countries, but the US has always been the final frontier for K-pop \u2013 a market that has been attempted many times with only minor successes by acts such as Big Bang, EXO, and 2NE1\u2019s CL. \u201cWe feel it all the time,\u201d says Jimin. \u201cOn this tour we played some very large venues, and it makes us see that people really love us. Being inundated by all these emotions, it kind of got to me.\u201d In a hotel in London, ahead of the UK shows, security stake out the hallways. Burly men accompany band members to the toilet. BTS have reached that dissociative level of stardom where they are handled like china dolls. \u201cWe know that popularity is not for ever,\u201d RM says with a smile. \u201cSo we enjoy the ride, the rollercoaster, and when it ends, it just finishes. We\u2019re on the jets and in the stadiums, but I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s mine. It\u2019s like we just borrowed it from somebody.\u201d BTS are the brainchild of veteran writer and producer Bang Shi Hyuk, who formerly worked at the K-pop entertainment giant JYP, then formed Big Hit Entertainment and debuted BTS in 2013. The normal practice of K-pop is to oversee every element of the life of young \u201cidols\u201d, as they are known in Korea. However, Bang gave BTS autonomy to run their own Twitter and vlog from their studio, and for the rappers to write alongside Big Hit\u2019s in-house production team. Their lyrics are emotionally vulnerable and socially conscious, sometimes bordering on angry, and go against K-pop\u2019s grain: Baepsae, which translates as \u201csilver spoon\u201d, defends their \u201ccursed\u201d generation. Critics have tried to unravel the secret of their US success: many credit social media with spreading their message, but BTS\u2019s fans, known as Army, flag the music and lyrics as the reason they have connected so deeply. It\u2019s this, plus the end of One Direction, the growing interest in K-pop in the US, and BTS\u2019s endless stream of visual content (from behind-the-scenes footage to reality shows) that reel in the curious and hook them with the force of the group\u2019s personalities. In time-honoured boyband fashion, they offer something for everyone. Like all pop stars with gigantic, powerful fan bases, BTS tread a delicate line between celebrating their admirers and potentially alienating them. \u201cFame is like a shadow,\u201d says Suga, their most serious member. \u201cThere\u2019s light and there\u2019s darkness; it\u2019s something that follows you constantly and not something you can run away from. But people tend to respect our privacy. We go to art galleries a lot and people don\u2019t really bother us, then after we leave they\u2019ll make a [social media] post.\u201d \u201cIf it gets too much and it crosses a line, then it can be a source of stress but for me, at least, it\u2019s a sign of their love,\u201d says J-hope, a former street dancer. On a recent album cut, Pied Piper, they playfully admonished the obsessives: \u201cStop watching and start studying for your exams, your parents and boss hate me \u2026 You already have plenty of my pictures in your room.\u201d That surprising honesty \u2013 in K-pop terms \u2013 underpinned the concept of their recent Love Yourself album trilogy (Her, Tear and Answer), which charted a narrative around, unsurprisingly, learning to love oneself. RM\u2019s speech at the UN echoed this theme: \u201cNo matter who you are, where you\u2019re from, your skin colour, your gender identity, just speak yourself.\u201d This relatively anodyne statement resonated in South Korea, where the president publicly opposes homosexuality. During their career the band have used Haruki Murakami, Ursula K Le Guin, Jung, Orwell, Hesse and\u00a0Nietzsche\u00a0as inspiration. The\u00a0latter\u00a0figures notably\u00a0in the theory of fate that is woven through Her, whereby love is destined and must therefore be unshakable (only for it to fall apart on Tear). As 80s indie fans did, BTS\u2019s Army now read these writers in order to fully understand the band\u2019s vision, while spending serious money on Bluetooth-programmed light-up sticks for their concerts. For many, however, BTS symbolise an industry that is little more than a high-functioning bubblegum machine. K-pop is perceived as cruel for its intensive training system, which can start when artists are seven years old and last for 10 years with no guarantee of a group debut; and for its harsh approach to idols who struggle with exhaustion and their mental health. Many have fainted onstage, while Super Junior\u2019s Leeteuk quietly set up a now-defunct peer group, Milk Club, for idols dealing with depression. Meanwhile, fans are portrayed as mindless teenage girls. \u201cIt\u2019s pointless to argue or fight about it,\u201d Suga says, gruffly. \u201cFrankly, I can\u2019t understand people who want to put down a certain type of music, whatever that might be. Classical music was pop music in its own age. It\u2019s a matter of taste and understanding \u2013 there\u2019s no good or bad, there\u2019s no highbrow or lowbrow.\u201d BTS\u2019s music began as old-school R&B and hip-hop, but has since incorporated a myriad of genres, from EDM to South African house. The lyrics, too, have become increasingly complex, closer to prose than simple moon-June-soon pop. In many respects, BTS fit the mould of a classic boyband \u2013 they look and sound great \u2013 but they are also grown men who cry, embrace and expose their vulnerabilities and failings even as a culture of toxic masculinity thrives on- and offline. It strengthens their messages of strength, love, hope and acceptance beyond what boybands have offered before. K-pop idols work intensively, in a world where a few careers will last more than 10 years, but many are over in just 12 months. This year BTS have released three albums (two Korean and one Japanese), toured the world and produced a third series of their travel reality show, Bon Voyage. Their schedule is planned down to the minute. \u201cI think there were times we were pretty close to burning out,\u201d admits Suga, \u201cbut it\u2019s inevitable and it\u2019s the same for people in any profession.\u201d Current and former idols have shifted towards acting, appearing on South Korea\u2019s variety TV shows, and explored solo careers. Suga\u2019s interests include architecture and lighting. Jungkook, the youngest member at 21, has taken up documentary-style film-making, his most recent short capturing the extremes of his life \u2013 the intensity of the stage and the stillness of the aftermath. He says he feels \u201ca lot of happiness when I think about things I can do in the future\u201d. He has energy to burn \u2013 he will later give himself a minor heel injury before the first London show and spend it confined to a stool, tearfully apologising for not fully participating. During a recent live session on streaming platform VLive, V, whose slightly hoarse voice gives the group a soulful edge, played snippets of solo work to much buzz. BTS\u2019s rappers have already released self-written and produced solo mixtapes, but the vocalists have yet to follow in their footsteps. \u201cI\u2019m working on it,\u201d offers Jungkook, when J-hope begins laughing. RM weighs in, amused, \u201cHe\u2019s getting ready for too many things! Films, boxing \u2013 he\u2019s planning so much that no one knows when it\u2019s coming out.\u201d A good-natured squabble breaks out. \u201cWhen J-hope gives me the beats, maybe I can get started on my tape,\u201d deadpans Jin, the oldest member at 25. J-hope feigns indignation. \u201cI gave him beats! He liked what I gave him!\u201d he says as Jin cackles at the ceiling. \u201cOn all the songs I make,\u201d V chips in, having sat back for most of the interview, \u201cI feel there\u2019s something that\u2019s just not there. I have a shortcoming, I can\u2019t finish a song, I need someone to help me. When I come up with something I can put out, I will.\u201d Suga jabs back. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be about 20 years then.\u201d For their fans it\u2019s this kind of playful teasing and natural camaraderie that makes BTS so appealing. For the band, their connection helps support their frenetic work pace. Openly ambitious, Suga has repeatedly stated that a Grammy win is his next goal and recently added playing the Super Bowl halftime show (71,000 people in the arena; 120m watching at home) to the list. Either could be the thing that cements BTS\u2019s status as household names. Right now, neither seems unreachable. \u201cWe want to show as much as we can,\u201d says Jimin, his gaze unwavering. \u201cWe only want to be able to show our best.\u201d  "

            "content": "K-pop fans and users of TikTok claimed tickets to Donald Trump\u2019s Saturday night rally in Tulsa then did not use them, as part of a coordinated effort which helped to leave hundreds of seats empty in a 19,000-capacity venue. As reported by the New York Times, the scheme stemmed from a 11 June tweet from the Trump campaign promoting free registration online and via cellphones. The scheme exploded on the TikTok app, where young users implored followers to join in. \u201cTrump has been actively trying to disenfranchise millions of Americans in so many ways, and to me, this was the protest I was able to perform,\u201d Erin Hoffman, an 18-year-old New Yorker, told the Times, adding that she reserved two tickets and persuaded a parent to book two more. Following Saturday\u2019s abysmal turnout, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale blamed Black Lives Matter protesters outside the BOK Center for the small crowd, claiming they \u201ceven blocked access to the metal detectors, preventing people from entering\u201d. In a statement on Sunday, Parscale rubbished reports of the TikTok campaign, criticised reporters and insisted attendance had been dampened by \u201ca week\u2019s worth of the fake news media warning people away from the rally because of Covid and protesters, coupled with recent images of American cities on fire\u201d. But politicians and analysts, many with children who participated, confirmed the scheme to disrupt the rally. \u201cHe was played by young people and K-pop fans who ordered tickets with no intention of going,\u201d said Joy Reid of MSNBC on air, following Trump\u2019s speech. As Trump and his campaign gloated that more than a million tickets had been requested, on TikTok, young people shared screenshots of themselves using Tulsa-area zip codes to reserve seats with no intention of showing up. \u201cIt spread mostly through Alt TikTok, we kept it on the quiet side where people do pranks and a lot of activism,\u201d one user told the Times. \u201cK-pop Twitter and Alt TikTok have a good alliance where they spread information amongst each other very quickly. They all know the algorithms and how they can boost videos to get where they want.\u201d Users of the popular social media sites have often sought to thwart conservative campaigning by far-right accounts. In recent weeks, for example, hashtags supporting \u201cBlue Lives Matter\u201d, a movement in support of police officers, were co-opted by fans tweeting memes of famous blue characters like the Smurfs and Captain Planet. New York Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio Cortez took a shot at Parscale while thanking K-pop fans for their diligent trolling. \u201cYou just got rocked,\u201d she said, \u201cby teens on TikTok who \u2026 tricked you into believing a million people wanted your white supremacist open mic enough to pack an arena during Covid. \u201cKPop allies, we see and appreciate your contributions in the fight for justice.\u201d The Trump campaign pushed back, accusing Ocasio-Cortez of encouraging a foreign-owned platform to interfere with US elections and politics. TikTok is owned by Beijing-based ByteDance. In a statement, Joe Biden\u2019s campaign denied playing any role in the social media effort. \u201cDonald Trump has abdicated leadership and it is no surprise that his supporters have responded by abandoning him,\u201d said a spokesman, Andrew Bates.

            "content": "It started as an attempt to blunt the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement but it ended in derision. When the #WhiteLivesMatter hashtag appeared on Twitter, its unintended descent into ridicule was driven not by hardened political activists but by a loose coalition of young people worldwide united by their love of South Korean pop music. Those hoping to hold back the tide of support for Black Lives Matter amid global protests against the police killing of George Floyd could only hover helplessly over their keyboards as K-pop \u201cstans\u201d, slang for obsessive fans, drowned them out by flooding Twitter with video clips and memes of their favourite artists, many accompanied by anti-racist messages. Their efforts met with approval from the world\u2019s best-known K-pop band, BTS. \u201cWe stand against racial discrimination. We condemn violence. You, I and we all have the right to be respected. We will stand together. #BlackLivesMatter,\u201d the band told their 26 million followers on Twitter. Having taken the sting out of an online racist backlash, K-pop fans mustered their forces again, this time to humiliate Donald Trump. His campaign chair boasted that nearly a million people had requested tickets to attend the US president\u2019s rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, last weekend, but he ended up speaking in front of about 6,200 supporters and organisers were forced to close an \u201coverflow\u201d area outside. A large number of TikTok users and K-pop fans, it transpired, had registered for tickets but they had no intention of attending. The result? Lots of empty space in the 19,000-seat BOK Center arena and a lonely walk home across the South Lawn for a deflated Trump. It is unclear how big an impact the campaign had on the low turnout, but many online users believe it was a factor. One K-pop fan said she had used false contact details to register for two spots. \u201cI heard it first from just BTS fans and then once I saw that it got to TikTok, I was like, oh yeah, this is going to blow up,\u201d said \u201cRaq\u201d, a 22-year-old student and Democratic voter in Minnesota. The hijacking of a divisive Twitter hashtag and the humiliation of a US president were demonstrations of a social activism that runs throughout the K-pop community, particularly in the US, according to CedarBough Saeji, a visiting assistant professor in Asian languages and cultures at Indiana University. \u201cAmerican fans of K-pop, and there are many of them, are outward-looking, open-minded, culturally curious and supportive of LGBTQ rights,\u201d she said. \u201cK-pop is not particularly political, but it is socially engaged. \u201cStars donate to educational and social justice causes, and fans follow that lead to volunteer or donate for issues like education for low-income families, care for the elderly or environmental protection.\u201d Brad Parscale, Trump\u2019s campaign manager, blamed the Tulsa debacle on interference from \u201cradical protesters\u201d, a description that might not be far from the truth, according to Jay Song, a senior lecturer in Korean Studies at the University of Melbourne. \u201cBTS fans have always been serious about politics and socioeconomic issues, ranging from youth unemployment, mental health, social and economic inequality and sexual minorities,\u201d Song said. K-pop fans\u2019 optimism mirrors a social awareness among the artists themselves. After BTS donated $1m to Black Lives Matter, a fan collective charity known as One in An ARMY after the name adopted by the group\u2019s followers matched the sum. BTS and other groups have also donated to other social and humanitarian causes, including Syrian refugees and campaigns to end violence against children. \u201cSeveral K-pop stars have significantly influenced the thinking and behaviour of young music fans by conveying meaningful messages in lyrics about issues such as social injustice, the social divide and corruption,\u201d said Jin Dal-yong, a professor at the school of communication at Simon Fraser University in Canada. There appears to be less enthusiasm, however, for global activism among fans in the country of K-pop\u2019s birth, where admiration for the artists\u2019 altruism comes with a reluctance to interfere in politics. Some fan sites have banned discussions on the subject. The campaign to support Black Lives Matter was widely welcomed, particularly after BTS\u2019s donation, but some South Korean fans said they were uncomfortable about taking on the role of Trump\u2019s online nemesis. \u201cBLM was understandable as it was about human rights, but it makes me uncomfortable to see my idols pop up in Trump-related news,\u201d one wrote on Weverse, BTS\u2019s official fan community app. K-pop fans and other online activists who coalesce around single issues could become a significant new force, according to Song. In recent days, copycat campaigns have appeared, including one that involved Twitter users transforming a #JapaneseLivesMatter hashtag into a photographic tribute to Japanese cuisine. \u201cK-pop fan raids on social media platforms is something we will see more of in the future,\u201d Song said. \u201cYoung people are taking out their anger and frustration through a peaceful online social movement. They feel empowered, and their message resonates online across different generations, locations, nationalities and ethnic backgrounds.\u201d Agencies contributed reporting to this article "

            "content": "\u2018This must be a breathtaking situation for you,\u201d runs the Monsta X song Trespass, in a rough translation. \u201cI\u2019m gonna be rude and enter your heart / My love knows no manners.\u201d It was their 2015 debut single, released after the seven-strong boyband were assembled on a South Korean reality show, and the lyric turned out to be prescient. For Monsta X\u2019s fans, who go by the collective name Monbebe (\u201cmy baby\u201d), the group\u2019s first major London show \u2013 an under-promoted gig last January having been quietly forgotten \u2013 \u201cbreathtaking\u201d doesn\u2019t do justice to the experience of seeing the K-pop princes in the flesh.  Many have slept outside the venue to reserve places in the queue, which stretches hundreds of metres down the road, and they\u2019re so charged up that they erupt into shrieks when a group of fans suddenly perform a creditable Monsta X dance routine in the street. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the fact that we can\u2019t understand them [the band primarily sing in Korean]. Their message is deeper than [that of] western artists,\u2019\u201d explains Teniole, a 16-year-old Monbebe who has never been to a gig before. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to belong to something.\u201d   Inclusiveness is key to their success outside Korea: this tour called The Connect. Monsta X are openly indebted to the fans, creating a comradeship of equals by frequently addressing them directly, and building Monbebe references into the jokey film clips that play while the group change clothes off stage. The fans do their part by roaring Happy Birthday to group main man Shownu, who turns 26 on 18 June, and singing along to Korean lyrics. The predominantly teenage female crowd, a slice of multicultural London just released from GCSE exams, fizz with joy each time \u201cMonbebe\u201d flashes on to the video screen. Some of the self-absorbed ninnies of western idol-dom might listen and learn.   Korean boybands exist to provide an entertainment package: like the US-chart-topping BTS, Monsta X are equally proficient singers, rappers and dancers, and prove the point by zipping between musical genres. Their core sound is the boilerplate hip-hop and R&B that influences every teen-pop sensation from here to Saturn, but during their show they consistently branch off. Emollient ballads are succeeded by party-starting EDM; a pretty smooch-fest called Tropical Night is countered by Roller Coaster\u2019s propulsive synth-pop. They spend time highlighting individual strengths, with tall, sparky Hyungwon executing a solo dance to Charlie Puth\u2019s How Long, and Shownu and slinky Jooheon delivering a supper-clubby cover of Bruno Mars\u2019s Versace on the Floor. Illustrating that too much is never enough, the song finishes with Jooheon\u2019s gold jacket exploding into a hail of glitter that he\u2019ll undoubtedly be picking out of his hair for the next 24 hours.  The music is interleaved with lengthy intervals of folksy bantering, much of it translated by an assistant in the wings. At these moments, Monsta X are a septet of Eric and Ernies, reeling off gentle one-liners and sight gags that reinforce the message that humour transcends boundaries. A dominant theme is their love for London: \u201cHarry Potter! Double-decker buses! Britpop!\u201d (Their next date is Amsterdam, where they will undoubtedly find love for bicycles and canals.) They pay tribute to \u201cBritpop\u201d by covering Ed Sheeran, who\u2019s playing a gig of his own tonight at Wembley Stadium, and the Monbebe join in resoundingly. No translation is necessary during this uplifting show of east-west harmony. "

            "title": "BTS K-pop band members must do military service, South Korea says",
            "content": "They may be South Korea\u2019s most successful cultural export and the first K-pop act to top the US album sales charts, but BTS must still perform military service, the government has said, defying calls from the band\u2019s fans for their idols to be granted an exemption. Almost all able-bodied South Korean men must start almost two years of military service by the time they are 28, although exceptions are made for classical musicians and athletes who win international competitions. They include the Tottenham striker Son Heung-min, who secured an exemption \u2013 along with his South Korea teammates \u2013 after they beat Japan to win gold in the Asian Games football tournament last year. K-pop stars, however, must take a break from their singing careers, the defence ministry said this week, despite speculation that new guidelines on conscription waivers could include BTS and other internationally successful artists. Instead, the ministry has reduced the number of exemptions in response to an expected shortage of conscripts as South Korea continues to battle a low birth rate. \u201cIn the case of BTS, I personally wish I could allow exemptions for them under certain conditions,\u201d the culture minister, Park Yang-woo, said this week. But he added that the government body that oversees conscription was \u201cinclined to downsize the overall scope of exemptions\u201d. \u201cUnlike classical arts or sports, it is difficult to fix the criteria of the selection in the popular culture and arts fields, which makes it difficult to institutionalise a waiver system,\u201d Park said, according to the Yonhap news agency. BTS\u2019s seven members are in their 20s but the oldest, Jin, will have to enlist by the time he turns 28 at the end of next year. BTS\u2019s management has said that all of the band\u2019s members would serve in the military without complaint. \u201cThe company believes military service is a duty,\u201d Bang Si-hyuk, the founder of Big Hit Entertainment, told the Hollywood Reporter last month. \u201cWe will try to show the fans the best of BTS until, and after, the members have fulfilled their service duties.\u201d BTS are worth more than $3.5bn annually to South Korea economy, according to the Hyundai Research Institute, and the band was the reason why one in every 13 foreign tourists visited the country in 2017. South Korea, which is technically still at war with North Korea, does not look kindly on celebrities who attempt to wriggle out of military service. Steve Yoo, also known as Yoo Seung-jun, was deported and banned from entering the South after he avoided conscription by becoming a naturalised US citizen in 2002, months before he was due to be drafted. Earlier this year, however, South Korea\u2019s supreme court said the justice ministry had acted unlawfully in banning Yoo from entering the country, paving the way for his possible return. "

            "content": "Is celebrity merchandise the new Monet? Auction houses are in flux, with more and more pop culture items being sold under the hammer for six and seven-figure sums. Last month, Julien\u2019s Auctions in Beverly Hills hosted a three-day auction of Janet Jackson\u2019s personal belongings, including some of her most iconic stage outfits. Buyers included Kim Kardashian, who snagged Jackson\u2019s outfit from the music video for her 1993 classic If for $25,000 (\u00a318,000) and, on Instagram, said she was \u201csuch a fan\u201d of the singer. \u201cA collector recently told me: \u2018It\u2019s cooler to hang John Lennon\u2019s guitar on my wall than a Monet or Picasso,\u2019\u201d says Darren Julien, the owner of Julien\u2019s, the only auction house that trades exclusively in celebrity items, explaining how 20th-century pop culture artefacts have become the new classic paintings, thanks to a generation of monied millennials. Although Christie\u2019s started its rock and pop memorabilia section in the 80s, Julien\u2019s, which began in 2003, was the first auction house to deal exclusively in pop culture items. Early auctions included the dress in which Marilyn Monroe sang Happy Birthday to President John F Kennedy (sold for $4.8m in 2016) and the moss-green cardigan Kurt Cobain wore for Nirvana\u2019s MTV Unplugged performance (sold once in 2015 for $140,800 and again in 2019 for $334,000). The Unplugged guitar went for more last year. \u201cAfter we sold Kurt Cobain\u2019s guitar for over $6m last year, we had buyers want the cardigan that we sold for $334,000,\u201d says Julien. \u201cThe sale of the guitar made $334,000 seem cheap. We had one client who offered over $600,000 to buy [the cardigan] from the winning bidder, but the buyer in our 2019 auction declined to sell it.\u201d Julien says that the shift from antiques and classic portraits to memorabilia was a long time coming. \u201cWhen I started working with Sotheby\u2019s in 1999, collectibles was almost looked down upon as something for fans only,\u201d he says. \u201cIts been slowly shifting.\u201d There has also been a rise in auctions of items still owned by the relevant celebrities, as opposed to property from fan collections. So items under the hammer may well owe their cachet to celebrities who are still alive and performing. \u201cI remember, when I was trying to talk Cher into doing the auction nearly 15 years ago, she said: \u2018[But] I\u2019m not dead,\u2019\u201d Julien recalls. \ud83d\ude31 | Kim Kardashian informou pelo seu instagram que comprou o figurino usado por Janet Jackson no videoclipe da m\u00fasica \"if\" no leil\u00e3o que ocorreu neste final de semana. - JJBRA quer saber, comprariam?! pic.twitter.com/zcBFtJynq2 \u201c[Those auctions] showed celebrities and this market that you don\u2019t have to be dead to have a successful auction of your belongings,\u201d he says, mentioning a Barbra Streisand auction in 2009. \u201cWe\u2019ve noticed that items are still selling for big money, even though the celebrity is still alive.\u201d The house went on to have similar auctions for Ringo Starr, Nancy Sinatra and Bette Midler. Julien says that hosting auctions for top celebrities makes it easier for others to jump in and have one themselves. \u201cJanet Jackson was one of the most difficult people to talk into an auction because she\u2019s so private,\u201d he says. \u201cEven Janet was surprised at the results and she really got into the process of not only creating an amazing video for her fans to see in her box set but surprising the fans on the day of her birthday, coming on the screens in the auction room to thank them for attending.\u201d In January, Julien\u2019s auctioned seven outfits from K-pop boyband BTS. The costumes from their 2020 video for Dynamite sold for $162,500, far above the $40,000 estimate. Does Julien think selling off items by relatively new pop culture figures is the future trend? \u201cYes, especially if it\u2019s a band or someone as hugely popular as BTS,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you take a set of outfits that are worth $2,000 and put them on BTS, have them perform in them in a music video and then the song is nominated for a Grammy, you just increased the value of those outfits 81 times.\u201d Next month, artefacts being sold will include Bob Dylan\u2019s handwritten lyrics to Lay, Lady, Lay; a handwritten letter by Britney Spears that she sent to a school boyfriend; and a scrawly self portrait by Cobain. \u201cThese lifestyle auctions have now become a way for celebrities to do something that helps build their legacy,\u201d Julien says. \u201cMany of these items belong in museums or in the hands of people who can properly preserve them, and it also takes the pressure off storing so many items for celebrities.\u201d The ears of millions of young music fans have been captured by its polished pop, foodies have been tantalised by its gastronomic delights, and the country\u2019s artists and actors are also part of a creative wave, known as hallyu, that is establishing South Korea as a major cultural force. Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s Son Heung-min was the latest to join the line of cultural pioneers, trotting off the pitch at Manchester City\u2019s Etihad stadium on Wednesday as his nation\u2019s flag was waved by a delirious Spurs fan and others sang a song dedicated to him: \u201cNice one Sonny, nice one son.\u201d He was not the only Korean hitting the heights in Britain in recent days, as BTS became the first K-pop act to top the national charts and their two dates at Wembley in June sold out within minutes. Son\u2019s two goals helped his team secure a place in the semi-finals of the Champions League, and although they were beaten 4-3 by Manchester City in a thrilling match, the result was enough to put Spurs through on away goals. With dazzling skills and a genial smile, Son has not only established himself as one of the Premier League\u2019s most prolific strikers but also as a South Korean ambassador who, along with his compatriots, is pushing the boundaries of their nation\u2019s popular culture as it blossoms in Britain and beyond. Some Spurs fans have booked holidays to South Korea, their interest ignited by a player affectionately called Sonny, who exudes a charm and grace not normally associated with British footballers. Those with adventurous taste buds have discarded the traditional post-match pint or burger to sample the delights of bibimbap or japchae. Selfies are snatched with Korean visitors to Spurs games as attempts are made to tackle the language barrier and discuss football and other things Korean. Son\u2019s popularity is also driven by his Roy of the Rovers story; he left home in Chuncheon, north-east of Seoul, aged 16 and went to live alone in Germany to realise his dream of becoming a professional footballer. He was signed by Tottenham Hotspur from Bayer Leverkusen in 2015 for \u00a322m and is now also South Korea\u2019s captain. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Sonny has had a major influence on many British people attempting to sample and understand Korean culture,\u201d said Sungho Min, spokesman for the South Korean embassy in London. \u201cHis popularity has opened up our nation and what it offers to a completely new section of the British population, not just those with an interest in things like food and art. Sonny and K-pop have done more to promote Korean culture in the UK than anything the government or official tourism department have been able to do.\u201d Son may be the latest face of the Korean wave but he is certainly not the first. For almost a decade it has been chefs and musicians that have led the way. K-pop, or Korean pop, with its catchy melodies and elaborately choreographed dance routines, has baffled music executives with its worldwide success. The phenomenon began in the UK with a major hit for Korean rapper Psy in 2012. The video for his song, Gangnam Style, has now had 3 billion views on YouTube. Now boy band BTS have established themselves as a global force. Their first appearance in Britain last October won full houses and hysterical fans. Launched in 2013, they are also the first K-pop band to top the US album charts and have more than 12 million subscribers on YouTube. Their female counterparts, Blackpink, became the first Korean act to perform at the Coachella music and arts festival in California, earlier this month, with their performance streamed live in Times Square. They also recently became the first ever K-pop girl group to make it to the Billboard charts with both their album and single of the same name, Kill this Love. Food has been a critical feature of the rise in popularity of Korean culture, and while London has an established restaurant scene, complete with celebrity chefs such as Judy Joo, the cuisine is also spreading beyond the capital, with venues flourishing in Manchester, Birmingham, Sheffield and Edinburgh. Almost all major supermarkets stock Korean ingredients or foods, and specialist Korean shops are now a common sight in most city centres. Jae Joon, manager of the Miss Korea restaurant in Birmingham, said: \u201cMost of our customers are not Koreans. The British have developed a taste for our food, which has further led to an interest in our culture. There was a time when people in this country didn\u2019t even know where Korea is.\u201d The Observer\u2019s food critic, Jay Rayner, added: \u201cKorean food has been on the rise over the last five years but in the past year it\u2019s really broken through. There\u2019s been a significant breakout of restaurants and supermarkets in London and other parts of the country. \u201cThe real benchmark is when you have mainstream supermarkets stocking Korean items, and this is happening more and more. It\u2019s part of the wider interest in Korean culture.\u201d The growth in Korean restaurants, particularly outside of London, is partly driven by an increase in students from the country attending British universities. There are an estimated 53,000 Koreans living in the UK, the largest community in Europe, of whom almost 20,000 are students. New Malden in Surrey is home to the largest concentration of Koreans \u2013 almost 20,000 \u2013 earning it the nickname \u201cKorea Town\u201d. The newfound interest in their culture extends beyond food and K-pop. Next month,the Korean Cultural Centre in London will host a festival to showcase the country\u2019s other musical talents. A Korean film festival is also taking place to highlight its flourishing film industry, underlined by the 2017 Netflix success of Okja, which tells the story of a Korean girl protecting her gentle giant friend. Last summer South Korea\u2019s most famous artist, Lee Bul, arrived on London\u2019s arts scene with her exhibition, Crashing, while another, Seung-taek Lee, exhibited at the White Cube gallery. Next month, Wales will host its first ever Korea Day with another planned for Manchester next year. Korean fashion brand Fayewoo, known for its elaborate party dresses, is popular with celebrities and social media influencers, and is opening its first European store in London. South Korea\u2019s cultural emergence is no accident. Struggling with the impact of the Asian economic crisis of the late 1990s, it formed part of a deliberate policy by the country\u2019s former president Kim Dae-jung to focus on culture to push the country forward, which was dubbed hallyu. Dwarfed by the might of neighbours China and Japan, he also saw it as an opportunity to establish his nation on the world stage and move away from how it saw itself \u2013 \u201ca shrimp between whales\u201d. Thanks to the wave, it is now becoming a giant in its own right. "

            "content": "With his penchant for posting topless photos of himself to his 181 million Instagram followers, Cristiano Ronaldo is pretty notorious for his vanity. (\u201cYes bro! Your body is ripped,\u201d wrote one fan on a photo of the footballer meditating in the bath). \u201cYou used to see Ronaldo standing in front of the mirror loving himself,\u201d said the former Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson in an interview a couple of years ago. \u201cBut it was a nice vanity.\u201d It is easy to find individuals who are preoccupied with their looks, but hard to define exactly what makes a person vain. Factors such as economics, culture and age all influence how much we care about our appearance. Is there evidence that people in certain cities are more image-conscious than others? This article includes content provided by Instagram. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies. To view this content, click 'Allow and continue'. Looking at data for cosmetic surgery around the world is one place to start. The International Society of Aesthetic Plastic Surgery (ISAPS) publishes data annually on the estimated number of plastic surgeons practising in each country, and the popularity of different procedures.  Bearing that in mind, the top five countries for the number of total listed procedures in 2017 were the US, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia and Italy (the data for 2018 is still being compiled). So that could be an indication that the major cities in those countries are places where looks really matter. However, South Korea is thought to have the highest density of plastic surgeons in the world: 2,330 for a population of 51 million. Compare this to the US, which has roughly triple the surgeons in the ISAPS survey (6,800) but also has a population six times larger (327 million). A BBC survey estimates that a staggering 60% of South Korean women in their 20s have had surgical and non-surgical procedures. The popularity of the trend is reflected in a music video released by K-pop girl band SixBomb showing off their before and after surgery appearances for the song Becoming Prettier. Seoul\u2019s swanky Gangnam District is the centre of this perfection-driven culture, with a reported 400-500 cosmetic surgery clinics in one square mile. The most common procedure is blepharoplasty, or \u201cdouble eyelid\u201d surgery, which creates an additional fold in the eyelids and makes eyes appear larger. Nose and jaw surgery is also popular. It wouldn\u2019t necessarily be fair to attribute this to vanity, however, says the Seoul-based YouTuber Alfred \u201cHaeppy\u201d Lueng, who documents Seoul culture in his vlog. \u201cSouth Korea is a very competitive society and many opportunities depend on looks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is required here to send a photograph with your CV, for example, whereas in other places that would be illegal.\u201d Choi Min, a surgeon at Answer Plastic Surgery in Seoul who specialises in facial surgery, says: \u201cIf we lived in a world where looks weren\u2019t important we would see very different movie stars and K-pop idols. For now, we live in this world and plastic surgery can even out the playing field.\u201d Seoul\u2019s ambitious young people see no reason not to have plastic surgery, says Leung: \u201cThere\u2019s no shame attached to it and people are only making small changes \u2013 natural-looking beauty is still valued.\u201d He adds that it is a misconception that Koreans are influenced by western beauty standards and are \u201ctrying to look more white\u201d through face surgery. Rather, economic pressure and historical Korean beauty ideals around eyes and jawline drive the appeal, research shows. In Brazil, cosmetic surgery is similarly considered normal rather than a vanity project, and is common among all strata of society, says the anthropologist Alvaro Jarrin, author of The Biopolitics of Beauty. The government subsidises almost half a million plastic surgeries a year through public hospitals, according to Jarrin\u2019s research, covering both reconstructive and purely aesthetic procedures. It is an urban phenomenon, Jarrin says. While Rio de Janeiro might be considered a prime spot for beach body-related anxiety, a density of clinics can be found in S\u00e3o Paulo too, as well as smaller cities such as Recife, Porto Alegre and Santos that are gaining traction as places for tourists in search of cosmetic surgery to visit. Jarrin says the availability of low-cost or free cosmetic procedures mean that people who can\u2019t afford to go private can have done it poorly by junior doctors or have new techniques practised on them, leading to potentially serious mistakes. People take such risks because they are considered worth it \u2013 beauty can be a means to combat hardships. \u201cThe conclusion I have come to is that beauty condenses all the race, class and gender inequalities in Brazil \u2013 and it is a very, very unequal country,\u201d Jarrin says. \u201cPeople see inequality reinforced by beauty and constantly talk about having the right appearance to get a job, or marry up.\u201d In the US, Los Angeles has long had a reputation as a city where looking beautiful and stylish carries the promise of really getting somewhere. However, Men\u2019s Health magazine\u2019s 2012 assessment of America\u2019s vainest cities ranked another California city, San Francisco, much higher than LA, based on sales of products such as at-home teeth whitening kits and hair dye. Tampa, Florida, came top of that list, with LA a lowly 60th. It seems that urban life is making us all a little vainer. Zion Market Research has predicted that the beauty salons and spas market will grow 5.8% by 2024, due in part to our \u201chectic and stressful metropolitan lifestyles\u201d \u2013 suggesting life in cities requires a certain amount of beauty-related armour to survive. Similarly, health clubs grew by 20 million members globally between 2017 and 2018, and the \u201cwellness\u201d industry is now a $4.2tn market. In the UK, a 2017 survey by a wellness brand found that Liverpool, Manchester and London were the top three \u201cfittest cities\u201d based on gym-going frequency. Meanwhile a US athletics brand found that the Bay Area in California, comprising San Francisco, San Jose and Oakland, was the most active metropolitan area in the US based on the number of available fitness options.  The lengths people will go to preserve or alter their looks and figures are not the only indicator of vanity. The instinct to take photos of ourselves and put them on social media has caused much debate about narcissism in 21st-century culture. In 2014, Time magazine ranked the \u201cselfiest cities in the world\u201d by analysing over 400,000 Instagram posts with both a \u201cselfie\u201d tag and their locations tagged. Makati City and Pasig, part of the Manila metro area in the Philippines, topped the chart with 258 selfie-takers per 100,000 people. Manhattan was second with 202 tagged selfies while Tel Aviv, Manchester and Milan were also in the top 10. \u201cWhile the metric of people who take selfies per capita is far from a perfect measure, it was far and away the most comprehensive means of comparing\u201d the 459 world cities in the study, the author wrote. The metric could also indicate levels of tourism and the density of nightlife hotspots, however. Ultimately, it seems clear that vanity and the pursuit of beauty is universal. After all, according to the late Ivo Pitanguy, Brazil\u2019s most renowned surgeon, looking good is something everyone is entitled to. As he once remarked, \u201cthe poor have the right to be beautiful too\u201d.

            "content": "A sex scandal swirling around South Korea\u2019s K-pop industry has deepened after a singer and TV celebrity admitted he had secretly filmed himself having sex with women and sharing the footage online without their consent. Jung Joon-young, who rose to fame after coming second in a TV talent show, said he would retire from show business and admitted he had shared footage of several women in a group chatroom. Members of the chatroom allegedly included Seungri, a K-pop star who was charged this week over allegations that he ran an illegal prostitution ring. \u201cI admit to all my crimes,\u201d Jung, 30, said in a statement, according to Yonhap news agency. \u201cI filmed women without their consent and shared it in a chatroom, and while I was doing so I didn\u2019t feel a great sense of guilt.\u201d \u201cMost of all, I kneel down to apologise to the women who appear in the videos and all those who might be disappointed and upset at this shocking incident.\u201d On Tuesday evening, police charged him with illegal filming and leaking visual material. Jung was one of three male artists in the chatroom, where some members shared secretly filmed footage of a sexual nature of at least 10 women, according to broadcaster SBS. The talent agency SM Entertainment dismissed speculation that one of its stars, a member of the boy band EXO, was part of the chatroom group. \u201cIt is a groundless rumour,\u201d it said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ll take all legal measures against those who are found to have committed unlawful acts.\u201d JYP Entertainment, meanwhile, denied rumours that a member of its girl group, TWICE, was among the women shown in the sex videos. Molka - secretly filmed images of a sexual nature that often end up online \u2013 has reached epidemic proportions in South Korea. Last summer, tens of thousands of women held demonstrations in Seoul demanding that the police take tougher action against offenders. The allegations against Jung and Seungri have rocked K-pop, whose global appeal generates billions of dollars for the South Korean economy. \u201cThis case just shows that male K-pop stars are no exception when it comes to being part of this very disturbing reality that exploits women,\u201d said Bae Bok-ju, a women\u2019s rights activist. Jung was charged in 2016 with filming a partner during sex without her consent, but prosecutors dropped the case after the alleged victim withdrew her accusation. Police in Seoul said they would question him over the new allegations later this week. Seungri, a member of the K-pop quintet Big Bang, announced his retirement this week, but denied allegations that he had procured prostitutes for potential foreign investors at nightclubs in the Gangnam district of Seoul.

            "title": "BTS review \u2013 warmth and wonder from world's biggest boyband",
            "content": "Twenty-five minutes after BTS were due on stage, a message is read aloud to a fidgety arena: \u201cApproximately two hours ago, Jungkook was lightly stretching in the waiting room when he collided with floor furnishings and suffered an injury to his heel \u2026 Following the advice of medical staff, Jungkook will take part in the performance tonight, but remain seated without choreography.\u201d Never mind the questions that this provokes \u2013 What degree of stretching? What kind of floor furnishings? \u2013 the upshot is that K-pop kings BTS, currently the world\u2019s biggest boyband, are making their UK debut one man down. That still leaves six to be getting on with, however, and it would be a churlish fan indeed who felt shortchanged. The other members \u2013 Jin, Suga, RM, Jimin, V and J-Hope \u2013 redouble their exertions, putting so much graft into their dancing that by the end of the first song, Idol, they\u2019re gulping litres of water. Perched on a chair on a wheeled platform, and perhaps grateful for the sit-down, Jungkook participates fully in every other way. On the solo showcase each member is allotted, he lavishes the full sweetness of his voice on the mid-tempo pop brooder Euphoria, while he\u2019s a versatile harmoniser on the group numbers, capable of airy heights and sultry depths. Urged on by the fans \u2013 who call themselves the \u201carmy\u201d \u2013 he\u2019s making the best of a frustrating lot, but eventually weeps with vexation. Pity also the thousands of army recruits who couldn\u2019t get tickets to this long-sold-out show, and couldn\u2019t afford up to \u00a31,000 charged on secondary sites. Though they could have watched the gig on a live stream, or followed events on social media, where #BTSLondon posts began stacking up as soon as they landed on UK soil on Sunday, there\u2019s no substitute for seeing the Seoul septet in the porcelain-perfect flesh. They also missed out on another matter of importance: the chance to meet other members of the millions-strong army. What fuels the BTS phenomenon is fan-to-fan camaraderie; translated into social media activity, the army\u2019s devotion has kept BTS at the top of Billboard\u2019s Social 50 chart for 95 weeks running. That nearly all their songs are in Korean has been no impediment to achieving success in the anglophone world \u2013 their last two albums were American chart toppers, and the first of those, Love Yourself: Tear, was a Top 10 UK hit. If anything, the Korean lyrics and BTS\u2019s winsome looks, along with a self-acceptance creed that feels like more than just well-meaning sloganeering, create an aesthetic that\u2019s a powerful inducement to their young female following. Two seats away from me, a 14-year-old is singing along, having taught herself the language at home. The other 20,000 people in the room, many shaking \u00a357 Army Bomb light sticks that connect with an app to change colour, are doing much the same. But globalisation works both ways. The foundations of this banging, glittery show have been lifted from western pop/R&B acts, as has their music\u2019s frenetic EDM and Bieberpop. Two things, though, are uniquely theirs. One is the emphasis on sumptuous visuals; even the dreamy videos shown while they\u2019re changing costumes off stage are so gorgeous they could be art films. The other is the warmth they extend to each other, with constant pats and touches, and to the army. If there\u2019s a message to this show, it is that everyone matters \u2013 a commendable takeaway.

            "title": "Spycams, sex abuse and scandal: #MeToo reaches Korean pop",
            "content": "For many South Koreans, the admission by a young man that he secretly filmed himself having sex with women and shared the footage with other men was yet more evidence of a culture of misogyny and sexual abuse that has put the country at the epicentre of Asia\u2019s #MeToo movement. The sordid details of the man\u2019s alleged misconduct sounded familiar in a society struggling to cope with a voyeurism epidemic \u2013 especially in a week when two men were arrested for allegedly filming 1,600 guests across 30 South Korean hotels with spycams \u2013 but with one crucial difference. The latest allegations of sexual misconduct involve some of the best-known figures in K-pop, South Korea\u2019s most successful cultural export. In the space of a week, allegations surrounding the singer-songwriter Jung Joon-young and Seungri, a member of the internationally popular boyband Big Bang, have snowballed into overlapping sex and corruption scandals that have exposed K-pop\u2019s dark underbelly and prompted a backlash among all but the most obsessive fans. Jung said he would retire from showbusiness and admitted that he had shared with members of a chatroom footage of him having sex with several women without their knowledge. Members of the chatroom allegedly included Seungri, who is alleged to have run an illegal prostitution ring out of nightclubs in Seoul\u2019s trendy Gangnam district. The 29-year-old singer has denied the allegations. Allegations of sexual misconduct have shattered the wall of silence that protected K-pop \u2013 the vanguard of the Hallyu wave of Korean pop culture whose global brand recognition ranks alongside that of Samsung smartphones and Hyundai cars. Reports of sexual and other forms of abuse have plagued other areas of the South Korean entertainment industry for years. It is a decade since the soap star Jang Ja-yeon killed herself at her home near Seoul, leaving a seven-page letter in which she claimed she had been the victim of sexual abuse and exploitation. Jang wrote that she had been forced to have sex with 31 influential men, including politicians, business and newspaper executives and entertainment industry figures. Some of the suspects were investigated and acquitted. Since then, South Korea\u2019s #MeToo movement, inspired by fury over the widespread use of spycams for molka, the secret filming of women in public places, has been credited with exposing sexual abuse and misconduct in the film industry, politics and the church. In 2017, the acclaimed film director Kim Ki-duk was accused of sexually and physically abusing an actress. Prosecutors dropped the sex abuse charge, citing lack of evidence, but fined Kim for physical assault. Earlier this month, Kim filed a damages suit, demanding 300 million won ($265,000) from a South Korean women\u2019s rights group that had campaigned on the actress\u2019s behalf. In February, Ahn Hee-jung, a former provincial governor who was considered a presidential hopeful, was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison for sexually assaulting a female aide. And in January, South Korea\u2019s human rights commission announced the country\u2019s biggest ever investigation into sexual abuse in sport, after a wave of female athletes came forward to allege they had been raped or assaulted by their coaches. \u201cThe new atmosphere created by #MeToo helped expose the K-pop scandals,\u201d said Lee Taek-gwang, a cultural commentator. \u201cThe tables have been turned and now the K-pop industry has been forced to confront reality. It has to create a new morality.\u201d While other sectors of the entertainment industry finally reckoned with the damage caused by tolerance of sexual misconduct, K-pop appeared immune, despite revelations of mistreatment ranging from labour law violations to psychological and physical abuse. Typically, promising stars are put through a gruelling training schedule as they pass along the conveyor-belt production of new girl and boybands to replace their quickly superannuated colleagues. Like their J-pop counterparts in Japan, young stars are subjected to strict controls over their private lives, including bans on dating, restrictions on mobile phone use and an expectation that they will sacrifice their health to achieve the desired \u2013 and in the case of female singers, highly sexualised \u2013 image. The sexual abuse allegations involving other prominent figures had primed the South Korean public for the contagion\u2019s inevitable spread to K-pop, according to Michael Hurt, a sociologist at the University of Seoul. \u201cPeople are ready to accept this has happened and that something needs to be done about it,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one who is familiar with the creative industries, especially K-pop, is surprised these things have happened. The sheer scale and immorality involved is driving most of the negative reaction in South Korea, but deep in the background is the fact that we\u2019re talking about a national shame on the international stage. It\u2019s a black eye to Korea, because K-pop is such a metonym for Korea.\u201d Over the the past decade, K-pop has helped South Korea project its soft power, even when perceptions of the country were dominated by its proximity to nuclear-armed North Korea. The boyband BTS alone are worth more than $3.5bn annually to the South Korean economy, the Hyundai Research Institute said in a recent report, adding that the band were the reason why one in every 13 foreign tourists visited South Korea in 2017. This week, the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, vowed to clean up the entertainment industry after more than 200,000 people signed a petition on the presidential office\u2019s website demanding a thorough investigation into alleged crimes. Along with sexual misconduct and prostitution, these include corruption involving a senior police official who allegedly turned a blind eye to alleged crimes committed at a club where Seungri was an executive director. \u201cThe current leadership of the prosecution service and police should stake the fate of their organisations on uncovering the truth and becoming a law enforcement agency that can reveal its own shameful acts in order to regain the public\u2019s trust,\u201d said Moon, a liberal who was elected in 2017 after abuse of power allegations toppled his predecessor, Park Geun-hye. \u201cWithout investigating the facts of the incident involving the elite class of society, we cannot say we have a fair society,\u201d added Moon, who ordered officials to reopen the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Jang Ja-yeon\u2019s 2009 suicide. The obsessive adherence to K-pop\u2019s established formula for success is producing generations of young performers poorly equipped to navigate the moral minefield of life outside their shared accommodations and recording studios, said Kim Sung-soo, an entertainment industry commentator. \u201cIf the agencies do not give sufficient care to their stars, including education and stress management, they will end up raising walking time bombs.\u201d  Investors, meanwhile, are losing faith in K-pop\u2019s financial pulling power. Shares in YG Entertainment, which represents Seungri, fell more than 20% after the allegations were first reported at the end of February, while shares in other top management firms have also been hit. Reports that a senior police official allegedly covered up Seungri\u2019s alleged crimes demonstrate that the male-dominated power structure created during South Korea\u2019s spectacular economic development in the 1970s and 80s has survived the global spread of the country\u2019s pop culture, according to Lee. \u201cThe Korean wave may be new, but it has failed to rid itself of traditional power relations that allowed men to do whatever they wanted because they were confident they would never be punished,\u201d he said. \u201cThey had a sense of psychological entitlement that it was acceptable to break the law.\u201d But he added that the involvement of some of the country\u2019s top celebrities should be the catalyst for reconfiguring how the entertainment industry treats women. \u201cThis is the beginning of a change that should lead to a transformation in the way K-pop views power relations [between the sexes].\u201d Signs that the authorities are taking allegations of sexual misconduct more seriously emerged on Thursday, when a warrant was issued for Jung Joon-young\u2019s arrest. Earlier in the day, the 30-year-old singer cried during a court hearing as he apologised for his \u201cinexcusable mistake\u201d. \u201cI apologise to the women who have suffered because of me,\u201d he said. \u201cI will spend the rest of my days repenting for my sins.\u201d As other artists were implicated in the scandal, Hurt said K-pop\u2019s global popularity and value to the South Korean economy meant it would survive the fallout from the scandals. But the industry\u2019s international profile would also place it under unprecedented scrutiny. \u201cThe only lever that you can use to force domestic social change in Korea is to put it under the international gaze,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why social media has become so important. Activists can now say that it\u2019s not just embarrassing to people who read Korean newspapers, it can impact us in terms of our GDP, so you\u2019d better pay attention. \u201cIn the past, powerful men would have done everything they could to make something like this disappear. They can no longer do that.\u201d "

            "title": "Lady Gaga: Chromatica review \u2013 Gaga rediscovers the riot on her most personal album",
            "content": "A criticism often levelled at Lady Gaga is that the fantastical imagery she constructs around her albums eclipses the music itself. But it\u2019s a sliding scale \u2013\u00a0and one that certainly mattered less when she was knocking out undeniable dance-pop party starters like Poker Face and Just Dance, or cementing her status as pop\u2019s freaky outlier on the twisted Bad Romance. That she appeared in alien-like form in that song\u2019s video made perfect sense: here was a chameleonic pop superstar in the vein of Bowie, Prince and Madonna opening a portal to an escapist dimension. Later, it made sense that she would lean into the imagery of hair metal on 2011\u2019s gloriously OTT, Springsteen-referencing Born This Way. Yet on 2013\u2019s bloated Artpop \u2013 billed as an exploration of the \u201creverse Warholian\u201d phenomenon in pop culture, whatever that may be, and featuring at least one performance in which she employed a \u201cvomit artist\u201d to puke green paint on her chest \u2013 the aesthetic felt more like desperate distraction tactics. Seemingly bruised by that album\u2019s relative commercial failure (2.5m global sales compared with debut album The Fame\u2019s 15m), she disowned dance-pop altogether on 2016\u2019s Joanne. Ludicrous lobster hats and sinewy meat dresses were swapped for pink stetsons and denim cut-offs, while early producer RedOne\u2019s churning synthpop was replaced by Mark Ronson\u2019s rustic warmth. Collaborators included Florence Welch, Josh Homme and Father John Misty, while the album\u2019s stripped-back sound pushed the rockist assumption that quieter somehow equals more authentic. Its middling success was quickly superseded by the Oscar-winning, chart-topping movie A Star Is Born, in which Gaga\u2019s character Ally was locked in a plastic pop v heartfelt rock authenticity war. But, as ever, it\u2019s all about packaging, and Joanne was as much of a pose as Artpop. In many ways, the ballad-free, dancefloor-primed Chromatica represents not only Gaga\u2019s most personal record, but her most straightforward. Obviously there\u2019s a conceptual framework \u2013 that title, despite sounding like a Mac software update, actually represents a planet anchored by equality and inhabited by \u201ckindness punks\u201d \u2013 but it feels much lighter than before. As Gaga said in a recent interview with Zane Lowe, she prioritised \u201csimple messaging\u201d, a phrase that would have been reverse-Warholed up its own backside a few years ago. Fun and dumb lead single Stupid Love aside, the majority of Chromatica\u2019s 13 short and to the point songs (ignoring three orchestral interludes that feel beamed in from another album) dig into the person behind the facade. On dark centrepiece 911, she details her reliance on antipsychotic medication (\u201cKeep my dolls inside diamond boxes / Save \u2019em \u2019til I know I\u2019m gon\u2019 drop this\u201d) over a chugging swirl of industrial synths, while opener Alice dismisses Gaga\u2019s damaging obsession with perfection over a sugary house confection. Babylon, meanwhile, buoyed by classic house piano and a soul-stirring choir, pulls off the very Gaga trick of conflating the big and the small, touching on the Bible, ancient mythology and, as she\u2019s done ever since the start, the complexities of fame.  The healing power of dance, cruelly frustrated by the current lockdown situation, rushes through the album like cheap poppers, with the 90s house pop of the Ariana Grande duet Rain on Me acknowledging trauma before dragging it on to a sticky provincial nightclub floor. The ludicrous Elton John collaboration Sine From Above \u2013 which, with its panpipe-inflected beat and unstoppable euphoric rush, would win Eurovision on any given year \u2013 digs deeper into this simple idea that music can soothe even the most damaged soul. That song ends with an unexpected shift into cranium-rattling drum\u2019n\u2019bass, a fleeting taste of experimentation that feels oddly missing elsewhere. While some of Gaga\u2019s best work was made quickly, often on the road in tour buses, the songs on Chromatica were passed around from producer to producer apparently to free up the process. (Strangely, this is the first album not to feature Gaga as a listed producer, with the credits naming everyone from BloodPop to EDM producer Axwell to noise merchant Skrillex, while maximalist alt-pop producer Sophie \u2013 who confirmed her involvement back in 2018 \u2013 is noticeably absent.) At times, as on the generic Eurodance double-whammy of Free Woman and Fun Tonight, it means the songs feel overworked: sometimes their often short running times deny them space to breathe (the claustrophobic Plastic Doll). Sour Candy, a collaboration with K-pop girl band Blackpink, falls disappointingly flat: aiming for the sweaty throb of deep house,\u00a0it ends up sounding like a dashed off, cheaply produced interlude.\u00a0 Gaga is on much safer ground gliding around the joyous French house swirl of Replay, which has a startling lyric about burying trauma in graves and scratching at the dirt of her psyche. It\u2019s another example of how, after years of using her music to try to heal other people \u2013 be it her gay fanbase on Born This Way, or her family on Joanne, an album named after her dead aunt \u2013 Chromatica finally turns that gaze inwards without ending the party. Unsurprisingly Gaga\u2019s truest self was always going to be as loud as possible. "

Paying up to $3,000 a month for training and board, 500 or so young Japanese people join Acopia each year. The school also fixes auditions for its candidates with talent management companies, which have been the driving force behind the \u201cKorean-wave\u201d pop culture that exploded on to the world stage in the past decade with acts such as the boyband BTS. An influx of Japanese talent is reshaping the K-pop industry at a time of increasingly bitter political acrimony between the two countries, which has damaged diplomatic ties. Tensions rooted in Japan\u2019s 1910-45 colonisation of Korea have risen again after South Korean court rulings against Japanese companies for forced labour, and amid a perception in Korea that Japan\u2019s leadership has not adequately atoned for its colonial past. Wakamatsu adjusts her makeup But the popularity of Korean culture and K-pop music is on the rise in Japan, with many fans and artists saying they are not bothered by diplomatic tensions. The willingness of Korean agencies to take on Japanese talent speaks to the strength of the ties between the two, according to one long-time observer. K-pop groups, and veteran Korean musicians, are selling out concert halls throughout Japan. For schools and agencies, Japan\u2019s music market \u2013 the second largest after the US\u2019s \u2013 is a big prize and many have been on a campaign to recruit Japanese talent. \u201cIt will be good if Japan and South Korea will get along through music,\u201d Hasumi told Reuters during a break from a Korean language class. A K-pop applicant performs at an audition in Tokyo Some Japanese transplants have already made it big. The three Japanese members of the girl band Twice helped make the group the second most popular act in Japan, after BTS. Their success has prompted JYP Entertainment, the South Korean agency behind Twice, to plan a group that will comprise only Japanese girls. Agency officials are reluctant to discuss their success in Japan and the infusion of Japanese talent, wary of fuelling a politically charged backlash, according to industry sources. There is no shortage of Japanese hopefuls willing to train under the watchful eye of the agencies, some having left successful careers at home to go in search of K-pop fame.

            "content": "One of the many festivals that\u2019s switched to digital this year, the Place\u2019s Korean dance showcase gives eclectic insights into South Korea\u2019s thriving contemporary dance scene. The only full performance included (and it\u2019s just 20 minutes) is Shin Changho\u2019s Beyond Black, for Korea National Contemporary Dance Company. It\u2019s as much a philosophical proposition as a piece of dance. The question: could AI create dance as well as humans can? Decades ago, Merce Cunningham was using computer programs to generate choreography, so it\u2019s a fair guess the answer is yes. Currently AI can choreograph only by \u201clearning\u201d movement from humans \u2013 although that will apparently change by 2045 when computer intelligence surpasses all human learning and the robots take over. In the meantime, AI program Madi \u201cwatches\u201d Shin\u2019s dancers and translates their joints and limbs into dots and lines, then extrapolates the algorithms to generate infinite ways to \u201cplace dots and lines in unique patterns\u201d, some of which the dancers relearned from the computer to perform in Beyond Black. You wouldn\u2019t know the movement\u2019s origin, although you could find something quirkily robotic in its isolations, like signals being sent to different limbs in turn, but there\u2019s nothing mechanical about its rough-edged, human performance. Whether people or machines create the steps, it\u2019s the humans dancing, and watching, who make the meaning. For a wider view on what\u2019s happening in Korean dance, there\u2019s a collection of six short films. I liked Seungjung Seong\u2019s Zzz, with dancers throwing themselves artfully around an apartment trying to catch an imaginary mosquito, and the clever Bookanima by Shon Kim, a flipbook-style animation using instructional illustrations of different dance styles: ballet, modern, jazz, tap, breaking. A voiceover from jazz master Luigi outlines his philosophy: \u201cNever stop moving.\u201d Joowon Song\u2019s film A Town with a Blue Hill is a grower. It\u2019s a bit like a surreal Scooby Doo, young people in brightly coloured clothing on a naive adventure. They explore and play in run-down streets on the edge of a built-up city, trying to hold on to childhood innocence and imagination against the tide of \u201cprogress\u201d. B\u00f6 Lee\u2019s White Cane is also set in the streets, filmed in a Kenyan market with dancer Steve Ongeri taking the sensations from around him \u2013 cloth brushing against his face, grain falling through his fingers \u2013 back to the studio to make new movement. The festival also features four documentaries, produced with the Korean Cultural Centre. They\u2019re not very slickly made, but they offer an interesting snapshot of four female choreographers\u2019 work and lives. Three are in the contemporary field: former Hofesh Shechter dancer Jin Yeob Cha, London-based Sung Im Her and Kim Bora of Art Project Bora, with recurring themes including feminist dance and working through the pandemic. The fourth is a little different, profiling K-pop choreographer Bae Yoon Jung. The K-pop dance moves come across as mostly cute, sexy and easily copyable, made to flood the global internet, but the backstage view of the business is an education. We see Bae calling a meeting of fellow choreographers to discuss copyrighting their work and whether choreographers should need a licence to practise. Then there\u2019s the fame machine that is the K-pop academies where future \u201cidols\u201d train. \u201cI hope the teacher will give us stern instructions,\u201d reads the translation of one hopeful. Fascinating. "

Since their debut in 2013, the seven-piece boy band \u2013 rappers RM (Kim Nam-joon), Suga (Min Yoon-gi) and j-hope (Jung Ho-seok), and vocalists Jin (Kim Seok-jin), Jimin (Park Ji-min), V (Kim Tae-hyung) and Jungkook (Jeon Jung-kook) \u2013 have prioritised self-reflection in their music. Inspired by US hip-hop, they drew on RM and Suga\u2019s reputation as underground rappers and j-hope\u2019s credentials as a street dancer to push an emotional, rebellious image: debut single No More Dream attacked societal expectations for their generation, quipping: \u201cWhat\u2019s your dream? / Number one future career as a government official?\u201d Although they\u2019ve since ditched the sleeveless shirts, heavy chains and regrettable hairstyles of their earliest years, the group\u2019s ability to ask weighty questions of themselves remains. Inspired by philosopher Carl Jung, BTS\u2019s most recent album Map of the Soul: 7 used seven solo tracks to showcase each member\u2019s personal self-enquiry, from RM\u2019s anthemic rap-rock chorus \u201cPersona / Who the hell am I?\u201d on the album\u2019s opener, to Jungkook\u2019s My Time, a neo-R&B song about swapping his childhood for his career. Black Swan, the record\u2019s dark, theatrical single, openly discusses the possibility of falling out of love with music: in its eerie video Suga confesses, crouched low on a shadowed stage: \u201cThat would be my first death / I\u2019ve been always afraid of.\u201d So it\u2019s no surprise that RM would muse openly about music lacking transcendent power \u2013 particularly as the group\u2019s Korean-language singles have received markedly less support from western radio stations \u2013 and speaks to how BTS\u2019s frank examination of their own artistry has challenged standards for authenticity in pop. \u201cI don\u2019t know that any other K-pop idols play off authenticity as well as BTS,\u201d says Professor Suk-young Kim, head of theatre and performance studies at UCLA, and author of K-pop Live, a 2018 book exploring K-pop\u2019s unique relationship to digital media. \u201cWhat fans prize most in BTS is their stories about their authentic feelings of knowing who they really are.\u201d She says that \u201cK-pop idols are well known for providing excessive emotional labour\u201d to their fans, often conveyed through elaborate meet and greets or low-key, intimate-feeling livestream conversations, and points out that BTS\u2019s debut coincided with the mainstream popularity of useful tools including Twitter and YouTube Live. Their label Big Hit even created bespoke social media platform Weverse to facilitate closer dialogue with fans. Moreover, the seven members have undeniable charisma. Early in their career they stopped appearing on South Korea\u2019s popular Idol variety shows, where pop stars are sometimes put in awkward positions, to create their own version of the format: Run BTS! now has more than 100 episodes, all involving the group competing in daft, meme-generating challenges. This summer Big Hit produced a miniseries featuring the band cooking, eating, hiking and napping in a beatific lakeside cabin \u2013 and little else. No drama, no conflict, the show was designed to give fans an even greater insight into the group\u2019s friendship. The most extreme moment? Probably when Jimin got tipsy and accidentally body-slammed a mosquito net. Reality TV is a major part of the western pop playbook, too: Cardi B span her unfiltered appearances on Love & Hip-hop: New York into major label gold and uses Instagram to speak frankly with her fans. Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift have similarly mastered the appearance of down-to-earth realness on social media, reaping great success from it. But BTS put their own twist on these often gendered, tried-and-tested storytelling devices, emphasising them as storytelling devices, and directly involving their fans in shaping these narratives. Prof Kim says: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an authentic self: it\u2019s about how you frame your story.\u201d In her opinion, BTS\u2019s boldest exploration of authenticity is in the elaborate Bangtan Universe. Contrasting with their cosy, tactile reality shows, the Bangtan Universe, or BU, is a dark origin story for the group that plays out over many BTS music videos between 2015 and 2018. The characters are named after and performed by the members, but it\u2019s completely removed from autobiography: V did not kill his father, after all, nor can Jin turn back time. The complex, non-linear narrative is told through clues, easter eggs and elaborate motifs, and has driven fans to create entire websites dedicated to unpicking the mystery. \u201cWe know, fans know, that this narrative is not \u2018authentic\u2019,\u201d Kim says, but argues \u201cthe degree of intensity and involvement [that fans have] in this narrative universe\u201d enhances an even closer, authentic connection. This bold act of storytelling develops the idea that K-pop should be a \u201ctotal production\u201d, as Bang Si-hyuk, the founder of Big Hit, once called it. More than a music genre, K-pop is a 360-degree mode of performance that puts an artist\u2019s singing, dancing, rapping, fashion, personality, and digital presence all at stake. It\u2019s why most K-pop artists begin their careers as trainees at a label, spending years becoming a complete all-rounder before they debut. But this aspect of K-pop is also what reaps the most criticism in the west. \u201cThe antagonism against K-pop [artists] is that they\u2019re just manufactured robots, and that\u2019s so dehumanising,\u201d Kim says. \u201cThere\u2019s a highly orientalist view that sees K-pop idols as not authentic enough for a western audience, which is problematic and insulting. I mean, what is authenticity in this hyper-commercialised music business?\u201d Western pop prizes authenticity, and not just in Cardi B\u2019s lack of filter, but an older notion that still drags on: \u201creal\u201d music is made on real instruments, written by the person performing it. Taylor Swift\u2019s recent album Folklore received her best reviews in years, partly because her obvious songwriting talent is read as more authentic when it comes on a quiet, folky record made with musicians like Bon Iver and the National\u2019s Aaron Dessner. Even Mojo \u2013 a legacy magazine with Bob Dylan currently on its cover \u2013 included the record in its albums of the year. Other major stars, often past the peak of their fame, have turned to the supposedly authentic album for a boost: think Justin Timberlake\u2019s faux everyman turn on 2018\u2019s disastrous Man of the Woods. Then there\u2019s the notion of the lone genius \u2013 the Ed Sheeran model that suggests that anyone could crack the industry with just a dream and an acoustic guitar, and that talent should just come naturally, whatever that means. K-pop doesn\u2019t play into these performances of authenticity, and so accusations of \u201cmanufactured-ness\u201d persist in western coverage of Korean pop stars. This paper\u2019s review of Blackpink\u2019s debut album provided one such example in October: patronisingly addressed to the \u201cparents\u201d of the group\u2019s fans, it lamented that the girl band \u201ceschewed the need to show a human heart at the centre of the K-pop machine\u201d. It would be easy, then, to consider BTS\u2019s new album Be as a play for authenticity as the western pop market perceives it: promotional images show the members holding wooden, analogue instruments in a vintage studio setting. Although RM, Suga and j-hope have always been involved in writing and production, the group have taken on additional creative roles. Jungkook has filmed their next music video, Jimin is the album\u2019s project manager, Jin is rumoured to be on fashion duties, and V is directing the record\u2019s visual aesthetic \u2013 this is the type of authenticity the west often craves. The group have also documented the making of this album through a series of mysterious yet revealing videos: one shows the members writing laboriously by hand, in others they are choosing between analogue cameras or checking lyrics in the recording booth. It\u2019s clearly designed to showcase their artistic credibility, but in a way that\u2019s strikingly different from the cringey Man of the Woods model. BTS document a self-effacing learning curve: Suga recently spent two hours livestreaming his guitar practice, reporting that he took up the instrument over the summer. They never hide their label\u2019s involvement, either: Big Hit staff are ever-present in their videos, supplying them with equipment, advice and technical help. It confirms their career-long narrative, that to be \u201cBTS-ish\u201d means to be a work-in-progress, always making room for future growth. You could of course argue that this is just another form of manufactured authenticity \u2013 and it is, in the sense that all authenticity is manufactured. What makes BTS revolutionary is their willingness to address that, while showing their doubts, flaws, and sources of support. They undermine both the myth of the lone musical genius and the stereotype of the K-pop automaton. Be\u2019s homespun aesthetic suggests a new articulation of the group\u2019s identity, but it centres yet again around their fanbase, using the easter eggs, clues and in-jokes developed over years of sharing storytelling duties with their fans. This is authenticity in a language only they and their Army speak \u2013 highlighting the hypocrisy of \u201cauthentic\u201d pop music is just a happy side effect. South Korean K-pop singers have performed in North Korea for the first time in more than a decade, watched by a crowd of hundreds including the North\u2019s leader, Kim Jong-un, and his wife, Ri Sol-ju.  It was the first time a North Korean leader had attended a South Korean performance in the north\u2019s capital, Pyongyang. Kim was seen clapping along to some of the songs during the two-hour concert on Sunday, and posed for photographs with the performers afterwards.  \u201c[Kim] showed much interest during the show and asked questions about the songs and lyrics,\u201d South Korea\u2019s culture minister, Do Jong-whan, said after the show. The South Korean delegation including artists, concert staff, taekwondo demonstrators, reporters and government officials travelled to Pyongyang on Saturday in a reciprocal cultural visit after North Korea sent performers to the south in February. On Sunday the taekwondo demonstrators performed at the Pyongyang Taekwondo Hall, drawing more than 2,300 North Koreans including Choe Hwi, chair of the national sports guidance committee. The concert, titled Spring is Coming, was held at the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre and featured 11 South Korean artists including Cho Yong-pil, Lee Sun-hee, Yoon Do-hyun, Baek Ji-young and the K-pop girl band Red Velvet. Seohyun, a female vocalist and actress currently with the South Korean group Girls\u2019 Generation, sang a North Korean pop song, Blue Willow Tree. She had performed with the north\u2019s Samjiyon Orchestra in Seoul in February.  Cho sang a string of hits including The Cafe in the Winter, Short Hair and Let\u2019s Go on a Trip. He held a solo concert in Pyongyang in 2005, the last concert by a South Korean artist in the north before Sunday\u2019s performance.  The same South Korean singers will take part in a concert with North Korean performers on Tuesday at the Ryukyung Chung Ju-yung gymnasium, a joint project between the north and south named after the Hyundai Group\u2019s billionaire founder, Chung Ju-yung, who had long advocated inter-Korean cultural and economic exchange.  South Korea\u2019s engagement with North Korea has continued to grow since Kim expressed his willingness for more contact between the two countries. Athletes from North and South Korea marched under a unified peninsula flag at the opening ceremony at the Pyeongchang Winter Olympics in February, and the countries have scheduled their first summit in more than a decade for 27 April.  The two Koreas are technically still at war after the 1950-53 conflict ended with a ceasefire rather than a peace agreement. "

Crying and embracing one another, young men and women dressed in grey and black turned out on Thursday as a hearse carrying Kim\u2019s coffin left the hospital in the South Korean capital. \u201cI am so sad that I cannot even cry,\u201d an 18-year-old Chinese fan, Chen Jialin, said. \u201cMy heart aches so much.\u201d South Korea has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of suicide, which is the chief cause of death of those under 30, and officials have urged distraught young people to seek help.  \u201cCopycat deaths after high-profile celebrities\u2019 suicides are very common,\u201d said Shin Eun-jung, an official of the Korea suicide prevention centre. \u201cThe late K-pop singer was very popular among teenagers, who tend to be particularly vulnerable to emotions and traumas.\u201d The singer, better known as Jonghyun, died in hospital in Seoul on Monday after he was found unconscious in his apartment. In a note made public a day after his death, the 27-year-old had said he felt \u201cbroken from inside\u201d, highlighting the pressures facing young people in South Korea\u2019s competitive entertainment industry. \u201cThe depression that gnawed on me slowly has finally engulfed me entirely,\u201d Kim wrote, adding that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t defeat it any more\u201d. South Korea\u2019s suicide rate of 24.1 per 100,000 residents in 2015, according to the latest data from the World Health Organisation, was more than double the global average of 10.7.  A health ministry official said: \u201cWe closely monitor news outlets as well as the number of suicides after celebrities\u2019 deaths to prevent a suicide contagion among the broader public.\u201d  The concerns spread to Thailand, where officials on Wednesday urged vigilance for fans of Korean pop music who might be at risk of suicide.  \u201cFans who are emotionally weak and depressed are at high risk when it comes to imitating what their idols do,\u201d Samai Sirithongthaworn, a Thai mental health official said.  Kim spent nearly a decade as one of five members of SHINee, as well as being a solo artist..  The Yonhap news agency said Kim had sent a final message to his sister asking her to \u201clet me go\u201d. K-pop singers can face demanding lifestyles as they are often groomed by music companies from an early age.  \u201cAs top stars gain popularity, they are very much deprived of private life,\u201d said Seok Jeong-ho, a psychiatry professor at Gangnam Severance hospital.  \u201cAs mental problems cannot be seen, the importance of immediate treatment is often neglected.\u201d "

Since their debut in 2013, the seven-piece boy band \u2013 rappers RM (Kim Nam-joon), Suga (Min Yoon-gi) and j-hope (Jung Ho-seok), and vocalists Jin (Kim Seok-jin), Jimin (Park Ji-min), V (Kim Tae-hyung) and Jungkook (Jeon Jung-kook) \u2013 have prioritised self-reflection in their music. Inspired by US hip-hop, they drew on RM and Suga\u2019s reputation as underground rappers and j-hope\u2019s credentials as a street dancer to push an emotional, rebellious image: debut single No More Dream attacked societal expectations for their generation, quipping: \u201cWhat\u2019s your dream? / Number one future career as a government official?\u201d Although they\u2019ve since ditched the sleeveless shirts, heavy chains and regrettable hairstyles of their earliest years, the group\u2019s ability to ask weighty questions of themselves remains. Inspired by philosopher Carl Jung, BTS\u2019s most recent album Map of the Soul: 7 used seven solo tracks to showcase each member\u2019s personal self-enquiry, from RM\u2019s anthemic rap-rock chorus \u201cPersona / Who the hell am I?\u201d on the album\u2019s opener, to Jungkook\u2019s My Time, a neo-R&B song about swapping his childhood for his career. Black Swan, the record\u2019s dark, theatrical single, openly discusses the possibility of falling out of love with music: in its eerie video Suga confesses, crouched low on a shadowed stage: \u201cThat would be my first death / I\u2019ve been always afraid of.\u201d So it\u2019s no surprise that RM would muse openly about music lacking transcendent power \u2013 particularly as the group\u2019s Korean-language singles have received markedly less support from western radio stations \u2013 and speaks to how BTS\u2019s frank examination of their own artistry has challenged standards for authenticity in pop. \u201cI don\u2019t know that any other K-pop idols play off authenticity as well as BTS,\u201d says Professor Suk-young Kim, head of theatre and performance studies at UCLA, and author of K-pop Live, a 2018 book exploring K-pop\u2019s unique relationship to digital media. \u201cWhat fans prize most in BTS is their stories about their authentic feelings of knowing who they really are.\u201d She says that \u201cK-pop idols are well known for providing excessive emotional labour\u201d to their fans, often conveyed through elaborate meet and greets or low-key, intimate-feeling livestream conversations, and points out that BTS\u2019s debut coincided with the mainstream popularity of useful tools including Twitter and YouTube Live. Their label Big Hit even created bespoke social media platform Weverse to facilitate closer dialogue with fans. Moreover, the seven members have undeniable charisma. Early in their career they stopped appearing on South Korea\u2019s popular Idol variety shows, where pop stars are sometimes put in awkward positions, to create their own version of the format: Run BTS! now has more than 100 episodes, all involving the group competing in daft, meme-generating challenges.

No drama, no conflict, the show was designed to give fans an even greater insight into the group\u2019s friendship. The most extreme moment? Probably when Jimin got tipsy and accidentally body-slammed a mosquito net. Reality TV is a major part of the western pop playbook, too: Cardi B span her unfiltered appearances on Love & Hip-hop: New York into major label gold and uses Instagram to speak frankly with her fans. Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift have similarly mastered the appearance of down-to-earth realness on social media, reaping great success from it. But BTS put their own twist on these often gendered, tried-and-tested storytelling devices, emphasising them as storytelling devices, and directly involving their fans in shaping these narratives. Prof Kim says: \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as an authentic self: it\u2019s about how you frame your story.\u201d In her opinion, BTS\u2019s boldest exploration of authenticity is in the elaborate Bangtan Universe. Contrasting with their cosy, tactile reality shows, the Bangtan Universe, or BU, is a dark origin story for the group that plays out over many BTS music videos between 2015 and 2018. The characters are named after and performed by the members, but it\u2019s completely removed from autobiography: V did not kill his father, after all, nor can Jin turn back time. The complex, non-linear narrative is told through clues, easter eggs and elaborate motifs, and has driven fans to create entire websites dedicated to unpicking the mystery. \u201cWe know, fans know, that this narrative is not \u2018authentic\u2019,\u201d Kim says, but argues \u201cthe degree of intensity and involvement [that fans have] in this narrative universe\u201d enhances an even closer, authentic connection. This bold act of storytelling develops the idea that K-pop should be a \u201ctotal production\u201d, as Bang Si-hyuk, the founder of Big Hit, once called it. More than a music genre, K-pop is a 360-degree mode of performance that puts an artist\u2019s singing, dancing, rapping, fashion, personality, and digital presence all at stake. It\u2019s why most K-pop artists begin their careers as trainees at a label, spending years becoming a complete all-rounder before they debut. But this aspect of K-pop is also what reaps the most criticism in the west. \u201cThe antagonism against K-pop [artists] is that they\u2019re just manufactured robots, and that\u2019s so dehumanising,\u201d Kim says. \u201cThere\u2019s a highly orientalist view that sees K-pop idols as not authentic enough for a western audience, which is problematic and insulting. I mean, what is authenticity in this hyper-commercialised music business?\u201d Western pop prizes authenticity, and not just in Cardi B\u2019s lack of filter, but an older notion that still drags on: \u201creal\u201d music is made on real instruments, written by the person performing it. Taylor Swift\u2019s recent album Folklore received her best reviews in years, partly because her obvious songwriting talent is read as more authentic when it comes on a quiet, folky record made with musicians like Bon Iver and the National\u2019s Aaron Dessner. Even Mojo \u2013 a legacy magazine with Bob Dylan currently on its cover \u2013 included the record in its albums of the year. Other major stars, often past the peak of their fame, have turned to the supposedly authentic album for a boost: think Justin Timberlake\u2019s faux everyman turn on 2018\u2019s disastrous Man of the Woods. Then there\u2019s the notion of the lone genius \u2013 the Ed Sheeran model that suggests that anyone could crack the industry with just a dream and an acoustic guitar, and that talent should just come naturally, whatever that means. K-pop doesn\u2019t play into these performances of authenticity, and so accusations of \u201cmanufactured-ness\u201d persist in western coverage of Korean pop stars. This paper\u2019s review of Blackpink\u2019s debut album provided one such example in October: patronisingly addressed to the \u201cparents\u201d of the group\u2019s fans, it lamented that the girl band \u201ceschewed the need to show a human heart at the centre of the K-pop machine\u201d. It would be easy, then, to consider BTS\u2019s new album Be as a play for authenticity as the western pop market perceives it: promotional images show the members holding wooden, analogue instruments in a vintage studio setting. Although RM, Suga and j-hope have always been involved in writing and production, the group have taken on additional creative roles. Jungkook has filmed their next music video, Jimin is the album\u2019s project manager, Jin is rumoured to be on fashion duties, and V is directing the record\u2019s visual aesthetic \u2013 this is the type of authenticity the west often craves. The group have also documented the making of this album through a series of mysterious yet revealing videos: one shows the members writing laboriously by hand, in others they are choosing between analogue cameras or checking lyrics in the recording booth. It\u2019s clearly designed to showcase their artistic credibility, but in a way that\u2019s strikingly different from the cringey Man of the Woods model. BTS document a self-effacing learning curve: Suga recently spent two hours livestreaming his guitar practice, reporting that he took up the instrument over the summer. They never hide their label\u2019s involvement, either: Big Hit staff are ever-present in their videos, supplying them with equipment, advice and technical help. It confirms their career-long narrative, that to be \u201cBTS-ish\u201d means to be a work-in-progress, always making room for future growth. You could of course argue that this is just another form of manufactured authenticity \u2013 and it is, in the sense that all authenticity is manufactured. What makes BTS revolutionary is their willingness to address that, while showing their doubts, flaws, and sources of support. They undermine both the myth of the lone musical genius and the stereotype of the K-pop automaton. Be\u2019s homespun aesthetic suggests a new articulation of the group\u2019s identity, but it centres yet again around their fanbase, using the easter eggs, clues and in-jokes developed over years of sharing storytelling duties with their fans. This is authenticity in a language only they and their Army speak \u2013 highlighting the hypocrisy of \u201cauthentic\u201d pop music is just a happy side effect. "

The boy band\u2019s latest hit single, Dynamite, will compete with releases by Justin Bieber and three other nominees in the best pop duo/group performance category when the US music awards are announced at an online ceremony on Tuesday. BTS\u2019s seven members appeared as presenters at last year\u2019s Grammys and have made no secret of their desire to win one of the coveted awards. The band thanked their legions of fans around the world \u2013 known as \u201cArmy\u201d \u2013 for their part in securing the nomination. \u201cThank you to everyone who listened to our music and empathised with it in difficult times,\u201d they said in a Korean-language tweet. \u201cAbove all, it is you ARMY that made the miracle of (us becoming) a Grammy-nominated artist. Thank you and love you always.\u201d The group added in English: \u201cThank you Recording Academy for this great honour. A video clip showed four of members of the band jump up from a sofa, clap and cheer when the nomination was announced. Thousands of fans retweeted the reaction clips and congratulated the group: \u201cSo proud of you guys,\u201d one said. Another wrote: \u201cCongratulations! You made it! You deserve it!\u201d BTS released their latest album \u201cBE\u201d last week and will perform in South Korea on New Year\u2019s Eve in their first live concert since the coronavirus pandemic forced them to cancel a world tour in April. The band has been at the forefront of the K-pop scene since their debut in 2013, and make a significant contribution to the country\u2019s GDP. Dynamite, their first track performed entirely in English, became the first song by a South Korean artist to debut at top of the Billboard\u2019s Hot 100, its main singles chart. Yonhap news agency noted that if the band walk away with a Grammy next week, they will become the first South Korean group to win all three major US music awards, along with the Billboard music awards and the American music awards.

            "content": "South Korean pop star and actor Cha In Ha has been found dead at the age of 27, the third young Korean star to die in the space of two months. Cha, who was a member of the K-pop group Surprise U and also had a fledgling acting career, was found at his home. His South Korean talent agency Fantagio saying it was \u201cfilled with grief at this news that is still hard to believe\u201d. A spokesperson said: \u201cWe earnestly ask for rumours not to be spread, and for speculative reports not to be released in order for his family \u2013 who are experiencing great sadness due to the sudden news \u2013 to be able to send him away peacefully.\u201d Cha (real name Lee Jae-ho) had recently started an acting career, starring in 2017 short film You, Deep Inside of Me and the TV drama Love With Flaws. Cha\u2019s is the third sudden death of a K-pop star in recent months. In November K-pop singer Goo Hara was found dead at her home, a few weeks after the death of her close friend and fellow singer Sulli. The deaths of both women drew attention to \u201ctoxic\u201d fan culture in Korean, as both artists were subjected to online abuse. Sulli had been one of the few K-pop stars to speak openly about her mental health problems and her death drew calls for greater emotional support for performers. The deaths also highlighted the problem of Molka, a practice in which women are covertly filmed so that footage can be uploaded to the web. In 2018, Goo took her ex-boyfriend to court after he threatened to release explicit footage of them which was filmed without her consent. In 2017, 6,400 cases of illegal filming were reported to police, with the figure more than doubling since 2012 when 2,400 cases were recorded. During the trial Goo was subjected to a online abuse and lurid tabloid stories, with experts putting the negative attention down to South Korea\u2019s patriarchal society. The deaths have shone a light on the pressures that K-pop stars are under. Earlier this year the hugely successful K-pop boy band BTS began a month-long hiatus, with their management saying the break would allow themselves to \u201cenjoy their normal lives as normal twentysomething young men\u201d. The band \u2013 which is worth $3.5bn annually to South Korea\u2019s economy, according to the Hyundai Research Institute \u2013 said they would have \u201cextended period of rest and relaxation\u201d to \u201crecharge and refresh as musicians and creators\u201d.

            "content": "Only a few years ago, Sulli and Goo Hara were at the height of their powers, two K-pop stars whose talents had brought them fame across Asia. But in the space of six weeks, both women died. Sulli, 25, took her own life in October after years of online abuse. Her close friend Goo, who was the same age, had just completed a solo tour of Japan when her body was found at her home in Seoul last weekend alongside a note that police said indicated she had been feeling \u201cpessimistic\u201d. Goo had made enemies of online commenters and the tabloid media for taking action against an ex-boyfriend who had allegedly threatened her with revenge porn. Sulli had attracted hate for her feminism and public battle with depression. Both refused to play the roles demanded of them by many of their compatriots. \u201cSome female idols have been ostracised for not smiling in a television show and reading a book about feminism that contradicts male-dominated, patriarchal South Korean society,\u201d Park Hee-A, a K-pop journalist, told the Associated Press. Their deaths, along with a recent sexual abuse scandal, have put the industry under unprecedented scrutiny over its treatment of women, many of whom are spotted in their teens and subjected to an unforgiving regime of song and dance training that leaves no room for everyday pleasures. They also pose uncomfortable questions about the toxic mix of misogyny and taboos over mental illness that experts say is ruining lives beyond the highly pressured confines of the music industry. Sulli was the target of online abuse for not wearing a bra, for live-streaming an innocent night out drinking with a friend, for addressing older male colleagues by their first names and \u2013 her most egregious \u201ccrime\u201d, it seems \u2013 for describing herself as a feminist. \u201cSouth Korean society is holding on to the idea that men must be respected and women are not deserving of respect, or at least not much,\u201d said Ryu Sang-ho, a neurologist at Haedong hospital in Busan. \u201cThe media feed off that, so it\u2019s no surprise that the public don\u2019t have any sense of empathy towards these women.\u201d A year before her death, Goo had taken her ex-boyfriend Choi Jong-bum to court after he threatened to release a video of the couple having sex. Choi was convicted of assault and blackmail and given a suspended 18-month prison sentence, but he was cleared of illicit filming. Both sides appealed and the case had not been settled at the time of Goo\u2019s death. There was little public sympathy for Goo during the trial, with the singer attracting a barrage of online abuse and lurid tabloid stories over her violation of an immutable law of K-pop stardom: to appear at once innocent and sexually available. \u201cThe topic of sex is taboo in South Korea compared to western countries,\u201d said Tae-sung Yeum, a psychiatrist at Gwanghwamun Forest psychiatric clinic. \u201cThere\u2019s a high moral standard required, especially for female celebrities, because South Korea is a patriarchal society.\u201d There are signs that attitudes are changing. Goo\u2019s death sparked a petition to the website of the South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, calling for stronger punishments for abusive online comments. It attracted more than 20,000 signatures in less than a day. The national assembly will soon begin debating a bill nicknamed Sulli\u2019s law to combat online abuse. But that is treating only part of the South Korean mental health malaise that has been brought into sharp focus by Sulli and Goo\u2019s deaths. It is no coincidence that a decade in which several celebrities have taken their own lives, including the male singer Kim Jong-hyun, coincided with a rise in mental illness and suicides throughout South Korean society. The country has one of the world\u2019s highest rates of suicide, which is among the leading causes of death among people under 40. Taboos about mental illness prevent many people from seeking help. K-pop stars, like millions of other South Koreans, are discouraged from seeking help for depression, which is still viewed as a failure of moral character. \u201cThe blame lies with South Korean society in general,\u201d said Ryu. \u201cMany people with mental health issues are reluctant to take medication for fear of being seen as weak-minded. Mental health problems should be treated in the same way as a common cold. South Korean society needs to catch up.\u201d Additional reporting by Nemo Kim in Seoul. In the UK, Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 1-800-273-8255.

            "content": "After last year\u2019s male-dominated Brit awards entrenched the clear gender disparity in British pop, this year\u2019s nominations go some way to redressing the balance. Dua Lipa, Arlo Parks, Celeste, Joel Corry and Young T & Bugsey lead this year\u2019s awards with three nominations apiece. The British album category also features four out of five female nominees for the first time in Brits history, with the aforementioned women joined by Jessie Ware and J Hus \u2013 a marked improvement on 2020, when the category featured no women. \u201cWomen have always made great music and wonderful albums, but this is the first time in the entire Brits history that we have dominated the best album category,\u201d said Jessie Ware. \u201cThe time is now \u2013 albeit long overdue \u2013 to start respecting and appreciating the vital role women, and their music, play in the British music industry.\u201d Out of 176 eligible albums, 121 were made by men or all-male groups, 55 by women or groups featuring women, and one by a non-binary artist, Sam Smith. Ten British female artists were recognised across 25 slots in mixed-gender Brit categories, up on last year, when only one \u2013 Mabel \u2013 featured. More than half the nominees for British album, female solo artist, male solo artist, breakthrough artist and single are non-white, reflecting the enduring dominance and evolution of British rap and R&B, as well as the diversity of the Brit Academy. With approximately 1,500 members, including artists, managers, promoters, media figures and label staff, this year\u2019s voting body achieved gender parity and 26% Black, Asian and minority ethnic representation. Dua Lipa is an established Brits darling: she won best breakthrough act and British female solo artist in 2018, and British single in 2019 for One Kiss, with Calvin Harris. Celeste also won the critics\u2019 choice award in 2020. But 2021 marks the first year of Brits recognition for the remainder of this year\u2019s most-nominated acts. Arlo Parks released her acclaimed debut album, Collapsed in Sunbeams, earlier this year, on UK independent label Transgressive. \u201cTo be nominated for three Brit awards at 20 years old as an independent artist is something that exceeds my wildest dreams,\u201d said Parks. \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t have the words to describe how grateful I am. This year has been difficult to say the least but art has been holding us together in some way, and I\u2019m excited to be part of this celebration of British music.\u201d Yet to release a full album, Young T & Bugsey are nominated for British group, breakthrough artist and British single. Joel Corry, who also only has singles to his name, is up for British male solo artist, breakthrough artist and British single. The category for British single features the 10 most successful British singles of the last 10 months \u2013 and reveals some of the continuing gender disparity in British pop. Dua Lipa is the only female artist with sole billing, for her single Physical. Elsewhere in the category, two women share billing with male producers: Gracey with 220 Kid for a remix of her single Don\u2019t Need Love, and Raye and Regard for Secrets. In the international categories, Bruce Springsteen receives his 11th Brit nomination. He won international solo artist in 1986. His age, 71, makes him an outlier in the youth-focused ceremony, following the lead of the Grammys earlier this month. While the international female category features entirely American artists, the international male category casts its net wider, including Nigerian star Burna Boy, Australia\u2019s Tame Impala and Canada\u2019s the Weeknd, alongside US rapper Childish Gambino. The same is true of the international group category, where K-pop stars BTS rub shoulders with Irish punks Fontaines DC, and American acts Foo Fighters, Haim and Run the Jewels. Artists who may feel snubbed by this year\u2019s awards include Laura Marling, Ellie Goulding \u2013 who recently published an essay calling for greater \u201ctransparency\u201d in cultural awards voting processes \u2013 and chart-topping rock bands including Bring Me the Horizon, Mogwai and Architects. It was a strong year for rap, but there was no room for high-charting artists including Nines, Digga D, Ghetts and Megan Thee Stallion. Sam Smith is also notably absent: their non-binary identity meant they were excluded from gendered categories, although their 2020 album Love Goes was eligible. A Brits spokesperson recently said that gendered categories are \u201cvery much under review\u201d. The Brits\u2019 legacy awards, which vary year-on-year but can include prizes for producers and outstanding contributions, are yet to be announced. Griff was recently named winner of the rising star award. The Brit awards ceremony takes place on 11 May \u2013 delayed from its usual February date by the coronavirus pandemic. Jack Whitehall will host for the fourth year running. Dua Lipa and Griff are the first performers to be confirmed.

            "title": "Why bands are disappearing: 'Young people aren\u2019t excited by them'",
            "content": "\u201cThe moment that we started a band was the best thing that ever happened,\u201d sings Matty Healy on the 1975\u2019s recent single Guys. The song is an ardent love letter to the band, and to the romance of bands in general: the camaraderie, the solidarity, the joyous fusion of creativity and friendship. It\u2019s an old sentiment but an increasingly rare one. \u201cIt\u2019s funny, when the first Maroon 5 album came out [in 2002] there were still other bands,\u201d the band\u2019s frontman Adam Levine told Apple Music\u2019s Zane Lowe this month. \u201cI feel like there aren\u2019t any bands any more \u2026 I feel like they\u2019re a dying breed.\u201d Levine was quick to clarify that he meant bands \u201cin the pop limelight\u201d but the internet doesn\u2019t really do clarification, so his remarks sparked bemusement and outrage among the literal-minded, from aggrieved veterans such as Garbage (\u201cWhat are we Adam Levine? CATS?!?!?\u201d) to fans of newcomers such as Fontaines DC and Big Thief. But hurt feelings aside, Levine was broadly correct. When Maroon 5 broke through in the 00s, there were new bands forming all the time, many of which quickly proceeded to go platinum and headline arenas. In the realm of pure pop, meanwhile, talent shows such as The X Factor became a reliable incubator of girl groups and boybands, from Girls Aloud to One Direction. No longer. Popular music\u2019s centre of gravity has undeniably moved towards solo artists, at least when it comes to serious commercial success. This paradigm shift has been obvious for a while now (\u201cWhat happened to all the bands?\u201d asked Rostam Batmanglij after leaving Vampire Weekend in 2016. \u201cIs it just that bands are corny now?\u201d) and has accelerated across genres. Whichever metric you use, the picture is clear. Right now, there are only nine groups in the UK Top 100 singles, and only one in the Top 40. Two are the Killers and Fleetwood Mac, with songs 17 and 44 years old respectively, while the others are the last UK pop group standing (Little Mix), two four-man bands (Glass Animals, Kings of Leon), two dance groups (Rudimental, Clean Bandit) and two rap units (D-Block Europe, Bad Boy Chiller Crew). There are duos and trios, but made up of solo artists guesting with each other. In Spotify\u2019s Top 50 most-played songs globally right now, there are only three groups (BTS, the Neighbourhood, and the Internet Money rap collective), and only six of the 42 artists on the latest Radio 1 playlist are bands: Wolf Alice, Haim, Royal Blood, Architects, London Grammar and the Snuts. Of course, radio and streaming are dominated by pop, rap and dance music but festival lineups don\u2019t point to a golden age of bands, either. Of those that have emerged in the past decade, only half a dozen have headlined either Coachella, Reading/Leeds, Latitude, Download, Wireless or the main two stages at Glastonbury. That\u2019s the 1975, Haim, alt-J, Rudimental, Bastille and Tame Impala, and the last of those is effectively a solo project. Only one band, the Lathums, appeared on the BBC\u2019s annual tastemaking Sound of \u2026 longlist this year, which is not unusual: bands haven\u2019t been in the majority since 2013. The album charts are still regularly topped by bands thanks to loyal fanbases who still buy physical formats \u2013 such as Mogwai, Architects and Kings of Leon in recent weeks \u2013 but not since 2016 has one hung on for a second week. So what happened? Art-pop band Max\u00efmo Park broke through in 2005, during the huge post-Strokes boom in rock bands. In the era of sales-based charts and Top of the Pops, they had eight Top 40 hits. \u201cBands were alongside pop acts on the radio and on TV,\u201d says frontman Paul Smith. \u201cWe did Top of the Pops with Amerie and the Scissor Sisters. I think it was healthy. It could be anything next: R&B, alternative rock, whatever. Music has been compartmentalised a lot more.\u201d Rock and pop now exist in different spheres \u2013 even the biggest bands struggle to crack the streaming-driven Top 20 \u2013 but bands are on the back foot within alternative music itself. One theory is that major labels avoid bands because solo artists are cheaper and easier to handle. Not so, says Jamie Oborne, whose Dirty Hit label has found success with bands (the 1975, Wolf Alice) and solo artists (Beabadoobee, Rina Sawayama). \u201cWe\u2019re actively trying to sign bands,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m desperate to find a really young band that I can help develop.\u201d The problem is, he says, there aren\u2019t that many around. \u201cIt\u2019s more likely now that a kid will make music in isolation because of technology. When I first met the 1975, they were all friends meeting in a room to make noise. So much is done in bedrooms these days, so you\u2019re more likely to be by yourself.\u201d Ben Mortimer, co-president of Polydor Records, says that cost is more of an issue for artists than for labels. \u201cIf you\u2019re young and inspired to become a musician, you face a choice. If you go the band route, you need to find bandmates with a similar vision, you need expensive instruments and equipment, and you need to get out on the road to hone your craft. On the other hand, you could download Ableton [production software], shut your bedroom door and get creating straight away. Culture is shaped by technology.\u201d \u201cStarting a band is hugely expensive,\u201d says Joff Oddie, guitarist with Wolf Alice. \u201cYou need an immense amount of equipment and a lot of space. I spent most of my student loan on rehearsal space. Travelling is expensive. Anything that can be done to make being in a band tenable for young artists is good, because the fear is that we\u2019ll lose that tradition. I think it would be a disaster if it\u2019s only open to middle-class kids.\u201d Mortimer, who started out in A&R in 2001 and has signed bands including Haim and Years & Years, says that Polydor are still launching young bands, including Dublin\u2019s Inhaler, while sister label Island has Easy Life and Sports Team, but there are fewer contenders than there were a decade ago. \u201cThe majority of young people aren\u2019t excited by band music in the traditional sense: groups of lads with guitars. And that\u2019s reflected in the number of streams these bands receive. That then impacts on what talented young musicians go on to create. If they\u2019ve grown up obsessing over rap music with their friends, they\u2019re more likely to start creating rap music.\u201d The ability to create laptop symphonies has also changed the shape of those bands that have thrived. Dominated by singer-writer-producers, the likes of Bastille and Polydor\u2019s Glass Animals (who recently ousted Olivia Rodrigo from the top of the Australian charts) make production-led pop, which means those frontmen are virtually solo artists in the public eye. Excepting Little Mix \u2013 who have seen one member leave and another sign a solo management deal this year \u2013 Haim might be the only young band around with more than one widely recognised member. Establishing multiple personalities in the public\u2019s imagination has always been trickier than selling one person, but MTV and a vibrant music press helped, while TV talent shows introduced group members to millions of viewers across several weeks before they had released a note of music. All three of those institutions have waned, leaving bands to make their own way in the online attention economy. \u201cSocial media has filled the hole, creating individual stars who are seen as more \u2018authentic\u2019 than anything the retro talent-show format could offer,\u201d says Hannah Rose Ewens, author of Fangirls, a study of contemporary fandom. Social media is built for individual self-expression. Platforms such as TikTok, Instagram and Twitter \u2013 and even the portrait orientation of a smartphone screen \u2013 give an advantage to single voices and faces while making group celebrity less legible. Even within indie-rock, the most band-friendly genre apart from metal, the cult of the individual is stronger than ever, which has the advantage of enabling more women to rise to the fore. \u201cPhoebe Bridgers, Soccer Mommy, Waxahatchee and other solo rock acts are essentially leading the genre now,\u201d says Ewens. \u201cPhoebe Bridgers, who is extremely online and very savvy about using Instagram and Twitter in a way that Gen Z finds relatable and funny, has attracted pop levels of idolatry.\u201d Perhaps, too, there is less of an appetite for the interpersonal drama of a group. In the time before reality shows, bands offered insights into group dynamics (if we\u2019re being highfalutin) or voyeuristic entertainment (if we\u2019re not). Even now, new generations of fans enjoy finding out exactly what Paul or John said in 1969, or which messy divorce inspired which Fleetwood Mac song, or how Noel and Liam came to hate each other\u2019s guts. On one level, every band is a psychological experiment in which disparate personalities are crammed into close proximity and thrust into the spotlight. You don\u2019t need bands for that experience now that it is the cornerstone format of reality television. The great tea-spilling, click-attracting feuds in modern pop are between solo artists, not within bands. In Asia, though, it\u2019s an entirely different story. \u201cIdol\u201d groups, painstakingly assembled, trained, styled and choreographed for maximum appeal, have been at the forefront of Japanese and Korean pop for decades. K-Pop stars BTS are the world\u2019s biggest pop group. \u201cStrategically, this system has more to offer to the fans than a solo artist,\u201d says Shin Cho, head of K-Pop and J-Pop at Warner Music Asia. \u201cIndividual fans have their own favourite members but also appreciate the chemistry in a group. There can also be sub-group projects that offer something different. The group format is viewed as more dynamic because there is simply more to do and show compared to a solo artist.\u201d Sonny Takhar, former global president of Simon Cowell\u2019s Syco Music, who worked with One Direction, Little Mix and Fifth Harmony, hopes that this is still possible in the UK and US, too, albeit in a less regimented way. Now CEO and founder of KYN Entertainment, he recently launched a new five-woman group, Boys World, who have racked up more than 30m likes on TikTok. \u201cIt\u2019s always been much more expensive than launching a solo artist,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, you need to exercise more patience in today\u2019s market. Gen Z has many choices and demands on their time compared with those of a teenager five years ago. There\u2019s a constant fight to gain their attention. Pop groups need to be very relatable. Every fan should recognise an element of themselves in the girls\u2019 personalities and lives.\u201d Takhar assembled Boys World through a more organic process than the old Syco model, giving existing members a role in recruiting new ones. \u201cThe girls were very much at the centre of each decision to ensure that they formed a gang of friends first and foremost. They have grown up on social media and are very comfortable using it on their own terms. It\u2019s far better than a formatted TV show. They are in control. The age of the svengali is over.\u201d The challenge posed by all pop cultural trends is to work out whether or not it is a permanent structural shift or just another phase. The right group at the right time, whether it is the Strokes or the Spice Girls, can change everything. In the short term, the pandemic has made it impossible for new bands to form and threatens the survival of the regional venue circuit on which they depend, while Brexit has thrown up expensive new obstacles for touring bands. Yet Oborne remains optimistic. \u201cI\u2019m excited about the wave of creativity that\u2019s going to follow this period that we\u2019ve just lived through,\u201d he says. \u201cI feel this hankering in youth culture for real experience and connection. I\u2019m still quite the romantic when it comes to music. Look at Fontaines DC. I see a picture of them and wish I was in a band. It\u2019s the same thing as walking down the street with your friends and feeling like you\u2019re part of something. Anything\u2019s possible.\u201d Regardless of trends in music technology, streaming and celebrity culture, there is still a lot to be said for being able to share the pleasures and pressures of life in the music industry with a group of peers. Having released four solo albums as well as seven with Max\u00efmo Park, Paul Smith is well-placed to compare the two scenarios. \u201cI can get things done a lot quicker as a solo artist,\u201d he says. \u201cI can choose the artwork, decide the tracklisting: little things that take us weeks because we have an egalitarian mindset. You can make a bit more money. But I love the communal aspect of being in a band. You\u2019re sharing everything: sharing the profits but also sharing the load. If you\u2019re a big solo star and you\u2019re not enjoying it, it must be one of the loneliest places you can be.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re fanatical about bands and being in a band,\u201d says Wolf Alice\u2019s Joff Oddie. \u201cA good band creates a community. They have an ecosystem that, as a fan, you feel like you want to be part of. Despite all that\u2019s been said about individualism, there is still a hunger for that collective feeling.\u201d Perhaps you just have to squeeze it all into a phone screen. "

            "title": "I have reported on 30 Korean celebrity suicides. The blame game never changes",
            "content": "On a hot August day in 2008, I was invited to appear on a TV entertainment programme hosted by actor Ahn Jae-hwan. I noticed Ahn was behaving oddly, walking nervously around the studio whenever he was off camera. He was running a business on the side, and it wasn\u2019t doing well. He was inundated with complaints and had become the target of an online boycott and malicious comments. I was very worried and mentioned my concern to an actress who was an old friend. \u201cI am worried he might choose to end it all,\u201d I told her. My actor friend said she knew his problems and that his friends and colleagues were trying to help him. Later that month Ahn took his own life. On the day they found him, the actor and I went to the hospital where his body had been taken. She was in such a state of shock that she was unable to walk properly. The waiting photographers caught all of this. The photos ran with the caption: \u201cActress in shock at not being able to get the money back from dead actor.\u201d She and other people in the industry had loaned Ahn money but the media portrayed them as loan sharks. People were looking for someone to blame for Ahn\u2019s death, and she was the easiest target. That actor was Choi Jin-sil, then one of the most in-demand women in the industry. Forty days after Ahn killed himself, Choi took her own life. I and a few other people had been out drinking with her just four hours before she died. I had heard her last words: \u201cAs the victim of internet hate I don\u2019t think abusive comments should be allowed,\u201d she had said. \u201cI want to campaign to stop them, retire from entertainment and do charity work, like Audrey Hepburn. I\u2019m tired of it all.\u201d I found out about her death at 5am the next day from her younger brother, Choi Jin-young, an actor and singer.  When I arrived at Choi\u2019s funeral, her younger brother started hitting me, crying: \u201cYou promised to protect my sister! Why couldn\u2019t you?\u201d Two years later, in March 2010, he too killed himself. Three years later, in January 2013, Choi Jin-sil\u2019s ex-husband and the father of their two children, the former baseball player Cho Seong-min, also took his own life. He had become the target of online abuse in the wake of Choi Jin-sil\u2019s death. Six years later, little has changed, and there has been another spike in high-profile suicides. Sulli was found dead in October, Goo Hara in November and Cha In Ha in December. Whatever change there has been has made matters worse. I dread getting calls in the middle of the night in case it is to tell me about another suicide by a South Korean celebrity. Suicide is not confined to South Korea\u2019s entertainment industry, of course. I have reported on the scene for the past 30 years, covering 30 suicides, and I can say with absolute certainty that this is a problem for everyone in South Korean society. The statistics speak for themselves. More South Koreans kill themselves than people in other OECD countries. The figures for 2019 have yet to be published, but everyone predicts South Korea will come top yet again. I can\u2019t explain why so many South Korean entertainers have taken their own lives. We can\u2019t pretend to know each motivation, whether it be money problems, relationships, family issues, declining popularity, online abuse, or any number of other factors. Attempting to explain each death would just encourage the trolls. The Korean Association of Journalists\u2019 guidelines advise reporters not to reveal the methods people use to take their own lives, or to mention the location and motive.  When Sulli was being criticised for posting \u201ccontroversial\u201d photos on social media, I said during a TV appearance that she was seeking the public\u2019s understanding and affection, and that her critics should take the time to try to understand her. I too have become a target. I get hate calls, texts and online comments daily. South Korean society obsesses over celebrity divorces, with speculation about who is the \u201cguilty party\u201d. There is a similar obsession with why celebrities kill themselves. Some of the responsibility has to lie with reporters who think only of how many clicks their articles will attract, even if it means spewing out falsehoods and speculation. There is no easy solution. Most entertainment reporters have to put up with job instability and low pay. In some ways it\u2019s no wonder some take such delight in reporting the demise of highly paid celebrities. Changes need to be made so the media are less dependent on the clicks salacious articles attract. South Korea\u2019s entertainment industry itself has to bear a lot of the responsibility. It treats celebrities as commodities from whom a few powerful agencies can squeeze as much income in as short a time as possible. Many celebrities are spotted as children and are not taught valuable life skills, only how to sing and dance. The situation is worse for female celebrities, with the public more interested in every salacious detail of their lives. We also have to understand why people feel moved to post vicious comments online. Our freedom of speech and privacy laws that allow commenters to remain anonymous need updating. At the moment in South Korea, someone who urges another social media user to die is fined an average of just $2,000 for their first offence. A well-known celebrity once approached me, offering to give me her \u201clast interview\u201d. She told me she had tried to kill herself several times. We ended up talking for three days. I told her I would conduct her last interview, but that it would not be for a very long time. She was not the first celebrity to ask me to do this. I have given them the same answer every time: Spring doesn\u2019t come to us from afar, but, even now, it is coming from beneath our feet. We were born without a reason, and we should keep on living without a reason. Kim is a South Korean journalist specialising in the entertainment industry.

Every familiar accoutrement of the boy-band genre was expected and accounted for on Sunday night and dutifully dialed to 11: the lasers, strobes, confetti cannons and pyrotechnics, the finely tuned choreography, the sleek, modern production ingeniously calibrated with a pitch-perfect touch of Vegas schmaltz. Yet Big Bang, the first and best idol group of Korean pop-music conglomerate YG Entertainment (whose exponents include Psy and 2NE1) and approaching their 10th year together, still manage to subvert conventions enough to set themselves apart from a billion-dollar industry\u2019s rank and file \u2013 and validate a mania that saw tickets changing hands for hundreds of dollars outside the venue. The group\u2019s five members, all established superstars as individuals in the Pan-Asian belt that represents K-pop\u2019s core market, blend the cotton-candy hooks typical of boy bands with a shimmery edge of sex and violence and sophomore-year nihilism, all within a catchy hip-hop package that draws from elements as far-flung as metal and dubstep. The result could be best described to your parents or the otherwise pop-illiterate as a far, far, far superior One Direction. This is fully realised pop as its inventive and sophisticated peak. The multicultural mass of fans that on Sunday packed the multi-purpose indoor arena to the corners, many holding tulip-shaped lightsticks aloft throughout, squealed full-throatedly as the group ran through a breathless 21-song set that drew from their biggest hits, including viral smashes Fantastic Baby, Loser and Stupid Liar. For two and a half hours, each of the five members\u2019 individual talents and personalities were showcased, often as the show made way for their solo material: G-Dragon, the profoundly talented frontman whose formidable musical chops are matched only by his androgynous, chameleon-like fashion sense; TOP, the oldest of the five and best rapper of the group; Daesung, the playful ne\u2019er-do-well with the exaggerated bangs who showed off his drumming talents with an extended solo during Sober; Seungri, the youngest member and \u201cglue guy\u201d who offers a little bit of everything; Taeyang, the standout dancer known for his soaring falsettos and creative coiffure \u2013 and who during one break declared his love for Shake Shack burgers to coos from the crowd. All of it was underpinned by an expert six-piece band and stage production helmed by Gaga and Beyonc\u00e9 collaborator LeRoy Bennett. After Big Bang closed the show with the three-song encore of Bang Bang Bang, Good Boy and Bae Bae, the crowd spilled deliriously into the Newark night. Although my own proficiency in Big Bang\u2019s native language is limited to the kamsahamnida that once got me through 10 days in Seoul, the Big Bang experience \u2013 mostly in Korean with the occasional English hook or chorus \u2013 affirms pop as universal touchstone and cultural panacea.  For someone born in the year 2000, Beabadoobee has an amazing ability to channel the 1990s. This sunny little number, about all the things we should have done before the eternal lockdown hit, lands somewhere between REM at their most earnest and the carefree bounce of Len\u2019s Steal My Sunshine. You can tell that the 1975\u2019s Matty Healy was very involved in the writing, but Beabadoobee really lives up to her name in the chorus, too, which is all \u201cShoo doo doo, doo doo be doo be doo\u201d. You\u2019ll want it on repeat for at least an hour.  Wow, OK Glaive, that is a sentiment I think we can all get behind at this particular moment in time. At 16, the small-town teen already has the measure of the world, and he\u2019s condensed it down into this easy-listening coffee advert soundtrack that suddenly morphs into a thumping hyper-pop panic attack. When Cleopatra and Madonna did it, taking a milk bath was for spurious skincare reasons. For King Kofi it\u2019s a little more political: he takes the milky plunge in the video for this remarkably restrained song about racism in dating. Gentle and warm, the song is indeed like taking a long soak \u2013 but the topic is as sour and unpleasant as the curdled milk into which he sinks. A really likable debut solo single from Blackpink\u2019s Ros\u00e9, who has apparently gone from owning nothing but a mattress (was she once a 21-year-old Tinder user in Clapton?) to being a member of one of the world\u2019s biggest K-pop bands. There\u2019s more than a bit of vintage Taylor Swift about it, with an acoustic guitar underlay giving way to sizeable synths and a strangely subservient beat. One good thing about this boring meeting of minds is that you have absolutely no legal obligation to listen to it. Another good thing about it is that it\u2019s only three minutes and two seconds long, so if the law ever changes, you will make it through.  "

            "title": "Why BTS are the K-pop kings of social media",
            "content": "In an age when the charts have become an algorithmic spaghetti of streaming plays, radio and downloads, the purest way of measuring who is up and who is down in pop might be the Billboard Social 50, a sub-chart that measures reach across social networks. At last Sunday\u2019s Billboard music awards, its output was reflected in the category of top social artist. This included four of global pop\u2019s usual suspects: Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez, Ariana Grande and Shawn Mendes. The winner, though, was none of the above. Instead, it was the group who have topped the Social 50 for 31 weeks in the past year: BTS. Yes, BTS, everyone\u2019s favourite seven-boy Korean pop act. Yes, BTS, the most-retweeted artist on Twitter in 2016, with 6 million followers, 4 million YouTube subscribers and 4 million fans on Facebook. As Kim Nam-joon (AKA Rap Monster) took to the stage to collect their award, the BTS fans, known as the Army (\u201cadorable representative MCs for youth\u201d), proved their point by tweeting the hashtag #BTSBBMAS more than 300m times. BTS\u2019s award reflects the increasingly outward-bound cultural power of South Korea. Their 2016 album Wings had the highest first-month sales in Korean history. In the US, it hit No 26, the best position ever for a K-pop album. The pop industry is a tightly controlled big-money game in South Korea. But BTS, which translates as Bulletproof Boy Scouts, and who are also known as Bangtan Boys, were the accidental product of a smaller independent record label, who spotted a market for a slightly more thoughtful tone within the exhaustingly energetic world of K-pop: the band have included songs about loneliness and gender politics. Their label was the first to embrace the messy, unvarnished nature of social media, allowing the band to reveal more of their real personalities. Plus, rather than taking the One Direction approach of having accounts for each member, BTS run only one group account on each platform, giving them cyclonic power with which to dominate the web. With seven members, they are petite in K-pop terms. Their rivals EXO started out with 12 members, split into two sub-groups. Their other rivals, the girlband Twice, have nine members. Both appeared higher on Forbes\u2019 Korea Power Celebrity list this year, but BTS\u2019s Army has allowed them to break borders. The band also have looks on their side. At the Billboard music awards, band member Kim Seok-jin went viral as \u201cthird one from the left\u201d when he was spotted in a red carpet photo by non K-pop fans. This was two years after he became \u201ccar door guy\u201d at an Asian awards show simply for looking really good while getting out of a car. BTS have expanded their reach via two Japanese-language albums, but perhaps it is a sign of the rising Asian century that they are not setting their sights on Hollywood. While they have sold out arena shows in Chicago, Illinois, Newark, New Jersey, and Anaheim, California, this year, BTS have no plans to release any English-language output. "

            "title": "Thailand rescue: we tried to dig our way out of cave, say boys \u2013 as it happened",
            "content": "The 12 players and coach of the Wild Boars football team dramatically rescued from a Thai cave last week have spoken publicly about their ordeal for the first time at a press conference beamed around the world. A packed crowd greeted the youngsters after they were discharged from hospital in Chiang Rai, and watched as they played with footballs on a small makeshift pitch before taking their seats. \u201cIt is a miracle,\u201d Wild Boars footballer Adul Sam-on, 14, said of the rescue, as the boys were gently quizzed about their terrifying experience. That\u2019s it for now. Here\u2019s a full write-up:  The boys are each given a heavy-looking white tub by a regional official. They are then ushered out of the hall and driven away in a mini-van.  Q: Do you plan to be ordained as monks as a tribute to Kunan?  Ake confirms that\u2019s the plan. A doctor said it was important that the boys be allowed uninterrupted time with their families, and appeals to the media to leave them alone. A psychologist says interruptions will disturb their chance of a normal life. Q: Will the four stateless players be given citizenship? The papers have already been submitted, a regional official says. The official passes on the best wishes of the King of Thailand.  The boys bow before a portrait of the King.  The boys then pose again on the stage and give a gesture of thanks before walking off the stage.  And that\u2019s it.  Q: What will you say to your parents?  I want to say sorry, all the boys reply. Many point out that they did not tell their parents they were going to cave but only practicing football. Another says he did tell his parents he was going to cave, but he told them the wrong cave.  One said he feared he would be punished by his father.  Q: What\u2019s the first thing you want to do at home?  The boys list their favourite dishes. One boy talked in his sleep about his favourite food.  Mark couldn\u2019t get out on the first two days because there was no full face mask small enough, a doctor said. Q: Who decided which boys left first? Ake said no one competed about who left first. He joked that those who lived furtherest from the cave were chosen first.  The boys were considered to be equally strong, a doctor said. It came down to who volunteered first. Ake said no one rushed to get out of the cave because we were so close to one another.  Q: Would you go back to the cave? Ake says he might with a guide. Another boy said he wouldn\u2019t go back.  Another confirms he was worried about doing his homework while in the cave.  Q: What is your dream?  I want to be a footballer, one boys says. I feel stronger and have more patience and endurance.  Titan says the experience taught me to value life.  Bew also says he wants to be footballer or a navy Seal. There is applause for that answer. Four boys also indicate they want to be navy seals. One boys says he want to play football for Thailand. Q: What lessons have you learned?  Coach Ake says my lesson is we truly appreciated all of your kindness. We have to be more careful and check on activities.  Another boys \u201cI promise to be a good person, a good citizen\u201d. Adul said it was on an unexpected experience which has has taught me not to live life callously. From now on I will live my life carefully. The boys played chequers with the divers. They lost to a Navy Seal dubbed \u201cking of the cave\u201d.  One of the boys described one of the Seals as like his father because he called him \u201ckid\u201d.  The Seal doctor who stayed recalled the death Saman Kunan.  Everyone was shocked when they heard of Kunan\u2019s death, coach Ake said. \u201cWe felt guilty, because of his death,\u201d Ake said. A picture of Kunan is shown to the media with messages written by the boys. The picture will be given to Kunan\u2019s family. Some boys read out the messages they wrote about Kunan. \u201cI want to say thank you\u201d, one boy reads. \u201cThank you from the depth of my heart\u201d another reads.  A British diver identified as Jason delivered food to the boys, a Thai navy seal officer told the press conference.  They considered drilling into the cave to get them out, he confirms.  Full face masks were found for the boys, the officer also confirmed.  Q: What did you think about when you were hungry?  One boy said he thought about fried rice.  Ake said some thought there was a way out of the cave, so they moved backwards through the cave. We heard the water rising towards us while we waiting to be rescued. It rose nearly 3m. They couldn\u2019t hear the rain outside, Ake said.  They tried digging for something to do, Ake said. We took turns, he said.  We tried to keep digging for a safe space. They drank water in between digging shifts, Ake recalls.  Ake said the boys tried to dig their way out at first. I said to them don\u2019t be scared, because the water will go down tomorrow, Ake said.  We saw water dripping from the walls so we stayed near the water source. At the time we were not scared, because we thought the water would go down and someone would rescue us. Ake said he tried to boost the boys\u2019 morale and tried to find water to drink from the walls of the cave. The water was clean, he said.  We had no food, we only drank water, one of the boys says.  Q: Why did you go in the cave?  Ake said everyone agreed to go to the cave. We had never been in cave, but posted about it on Facebook, he said. They saw water coming into the cave and considered leaving the cave. They did not go into the cave because of the birthday for Nite, he clarified.  We knew we were trapped on our way back. We had to get wet and swim. We all can swim, Ake said. It was not true that we could not swim, after football we do swimming activities.  We didn\u2019t realise how far the water could rise, Ake said.  Someone shouted \u201care we lost?\u201d, Ake said. Ake said he reassured them that they were not lost and could get out with ropes.  When they realised they were trapped one boy said he thought of his mother.  Dul recalls telling the divers they had been in the cave for 10 days. Their brains were very slow at the time, he said.  Bew said the group were hungry, the questioner prompts. Q Did you watch the World Cup final?  Ake said it was fun. A boy who cheered the loudest during the game recalls watching the match.  Ake said most of the team backed France in the final.  Q What was it like when he you saw the British divers?  Dul says they heard someone speaking and listened not believing anyone was there. Mick who had a torched approached the British divers.  When he emerged I said \u201chello\u201d, Dul said. They were surprised that he was not a Thai. This was a miracle moment, he said. Dul responded \u201cwe\u2019re fine\u201d Dul recalls.  When he said there were 13 safe in the cave, the rescuer said \u201cbrilliant\u201d. Coach Ake said he urged Dul to translate what the British divers were saying. Ake recalls Dul urging the team to be patient.  The team introduce themselves in turn starting with Ake, the 25-year-old coach.  The three Thai navy Seals who stayed with the cave with the boys also identify themselves.  "

Here is a guide to the propaganda playlist Seoul began blasting across the border on Friday in response to Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear test earlier this week: A fusion of Korean traditional and popular music, its chorus is lifted from the most famous of all Korean folk songs, Arirang, which is popular on both sides of the border. Lee\u2019s song tells of someone being visited every decade by the \u201cdeath angel\u201d but refusing to be taken because they still have too much to live for: \u201cIf, at age 80, the death angel comes to take me away/ Please tell him, I am still too useful to go right now.\u201d It was so popular that Kakao Talk, South Korea\u2019s most popular messenger app, created emojis of the music video. It also, inevitably, inspired a host of online parodies and memes, and political parties reportedly sought to use it in their campaigns during upcoming general elections. Me Gustas Tu is about a girl who is trying to muster courage and overcome shyness to ask a boy out on a date. GFriend rose to fame last year when a fan posted a video on YouTube showing its members standing up after falling several times on a slippery stage to complete an outdoor performance. The YouTube video (above) has had nearly 9 million views since it was uploaded in September. Let Us Just Love was the soundtrack for South Korean workplace romantic comedy television series Protect the Boss, about, according to Wikipedia, \u201can incredibly immature young man who is useless at his job\u201d. Hello there, Kim Jong-un!

South Korea uses propaganda to boast of its democracy and culture, but the defence ministry says K-pop songs will also pique interests of the listeners in the North. North Koreans are prohibited from listening to K-pop, and are allowed to listen only to government-controlled radio stations or TV channels. Despite that, North Korean defectors say South Korean music is popular in their home country, with songs and other elements of South Korea popular culture smuggled in on USB sticks and DVDs.

            "content": "Kim Jong-hyun, the lead singer of the hugely popular and influential South Korean boyband SHINee, has died at the age of 27. The star, better known as Jonghyun, was found unconscious at his home in Seoul on Monday evening in an apparent suicide, South Korean media reported.  SHINee were formed in 2008 by the South Korean company SM Entertainment, and belong to the genre known as K-pop \u2013 a highly visual form of Korean pop that incorporates elements of western music. They went on to achieve great success in their home country, selling hundreds of thousands of albums and singles. In 2011, they broke the Japanese market and went on to become one of the most successful South Korean acts in the country: the Japanese-language version of their single Replay sold more than 100,000 copies there.  News of Kim\u2019s death prompted a flurry of messages on social media, with many fans voicing disbelief. A Twitter account devoted to K-pop photos said: \u201cSending our deepest condolences to SHINee Jonghyun and those who known him well. If you\u2019re going through a hard time, please do know that you never walk alone. Talk to someone and take care of yourself.\u201d Another Twitter user wrote: \u201cToday we lost one of the most talented artists in Korea. I\u2019m heartbroken and devastated by the news.\u201d Police arrived at Kim\u2019s apartment after receiving an emergency call from his sister, according to South Korean media. The singer was taken to a nearby hospital and was later pronounced dead, police said. The Yonhap agency reported that Kim\u2019s sister had received a text message from her brother shortly before his death that read: \u201cPlease let me go. Tell me I did well. Final farewell.\u201d The five-member boyband, with Kim as their main vocalist, released their debut album, The SHINee World, in 2008. They have since released five more Korean albums and another five aimed at the Japanese market \u2013 the most recent in January this year. All of their Korean albums except their debut have topped the charts in their home country.  SHINee are considered among the best live performers in K-pop and have won multiple awards for their complex dance routines. They have also become known for setting trends in South Korea \u2013 including popularising skinny jeans. The group are frequently referred to by the moniker \u201cthe princes of K-pop\u201d. Kim also had a successful career as a solo singer-songwriter. He released three records: an album called She Is in 2016, which topped the Korean charts, and two compilations in 2015 and 2017. In 2015, he released a book called Skeleton Flower, which detailed the stories behind his songs. In 2010, along with other major Korean artists, he contributed vocals to Let\u2019s Go, a campaign song for the G20 summit, which was held in Seoul.  Throughout his career he collaborated with numerous other Korean artists and also hosted his own radio show on the Korean station MBC.  Kim last appeared in public at a solo concert in Seoul this month. "

We are used to seeing EXO deliver their best and make everyone proud.\u201d  A South Korean court has sentenced two K-pop stars to six and five years in prison for gang-rape and additionally convicted one of them for distributing videos of the assaults and other sexual encounters. Jung Joon-young, a singer-songwriter, and Choi Jong-hoon, a former member of the boy band FT Island, were found guilty of gang-raping two different women in two incidents in 2016. Separately, 30-year-old Jung was convicted of filming himself having sex with other women without their knowledge and sharing the footage without their consent. It is the highest-profile example of an epidemic of spycam crimes in South Korea, which have prompted widespread anger and led to women demonstrating in Seoul chanting: \u201cMy life is not your porn.\u201d Jung distributed his videos in mobile chatrooms with recipients including a fellow K-pop star, Seungri of BigBang, who has been accused of illegal gambling in connection with a sex and drugs scandal. Jung was jailed for six years and Choi, 29, for five. Seoul central district court rejected the defendants\u2019 claim that the sex was consensual. \u201cJung and Choi took part in gang-rape of victims who were intoxicated and unable to resist,\u201d the verdict said, according to Yonhap news agency. \u201cIt is hard to fathom the extent of suffering the victims must have gone through.\u201d The court said the two singers had seen the victims as \u201csexual objects\u201d to be exploited, adding: \u201cThey should assume social responsibility in proportion to their fame and wealth.\u201d Both men wept when the sentences were announced. While the minimum sentence for rape in South Korea is three years, most online commentators said the penalties were too lenient. \u201cThe victims have to live in agony for the next 60 years, not just six,\u201d one poster wrote on the country\u2019s largest portal site, Naver. Another added: \u201cI hear they burst into tears at sentencing. The victims will live in tears for the rest of their lives.\u201d Jung rose to fame in 2014 when he came third in an audition show, Super Star K, and he had a number of solo hits before the video scandal broke in March, when he announced his retirement. At that time the rape accusations had yet to emerge, and he said he had \u201ccommitted crimes that cannot be forgiven\u201d.  There was no immediate statement from his lawyers or his record company on Friday. Known as molka, South Korean spycam videos are largely made by men secretly filming women in schools, toilets and elsewhere, although the term can also be applied to clandestinely shot footage of consensual sex. Last weekend Goo Hara, a former member of the girl group Kara, died in an apparent suicide a year after she was blackmailed over revenge porn. Goo\u2019s ex-boyfriend threatened to \u201cend her entertainment career\u201d by leaking the footage, and a CCTV clip showed her kneeling before him apparently begging him not to. He was convicted of blackmail. In conservative South Korea, women who appear in such videos often feel deep shame despite being the victims, and face the threat of ostracism and social isolation. Around 5,500 people were arrested for molka offences last year, 97% of them men, according to police data. "

            "content": "The heat and organised chaos hit you like a fist. The windowless dressing room in one of Seoul\u2019s major TV studios isn\u2019t much bigger than a double bedroom, but is crowded with 11 staff and the seven members of K-pop group Monsta X, who are promoting their new single: the seductive, dramatic Jealousy. Vocalists Shownu, Kihyun, Minhyuk, Hyungwon and Wonho, and rappers Jooheon and I.M, are now seasoned \u201cidols\u201d, as K-pop stars are called, and oblivious to this lack of space. Within a culture of seniority, a dressing room is earned; until recently, they were in a communal room with other young teams (known as \u201crookies\u201d) with flimsy dividers for privacy. Wonho, 25, whose infectious laugh belies a thoughtful intensity, is practising dance moves while the softly spoken 25-year-old Shownu, Monsta X\u2019s team leader, whose duty is to \u201cguide them in the right direction and keep them sharp\u201d, asks if we have eaten. Red-haired Kihyun, 24, brings over iced Americano. They are running on zero sleep from a trip to the south-east city of Ulsan the day before, where they performed in a rainstorm on a TV show. Fan footage shows Kihyun falling over, but he shrugs it off. \u201cFrom our debut, we\u2019ve experienced stuff like this. I knew I was going to slip. In my head it\u2019s: \u2018Choreography! Choreography!\u2019 so I go into the next move. It\u2019s not something to be embarrassed about.\u201d K-pop\u2019s hyper-produced earworm songs and visual perfection have had a recent boom of global interest, spearheaded by boyband BTS, whose phenomenal success has crossed over into the US and the Billboard Hot 100, and whose every tweet is shared hundreds of thousands of times; they have just booked two nights at London\u2019s O2 Arena in October. But the cameras of Korean fans, who post online every minute of an idol\u2019s public life, reveal a strenuous existence. K-pop can seem like a factory, its idols helpless drones rather than artists, and the stress and fatigue are often in the spotlight: 33-year-old Seo Minwoo, of the group 100%, died of a reported heart attack in March, while Shinee member Jonghyun, struggling with depression, took his life last December. Ms Suh and Ms Shim, executive directors at Monsta X\u2019s agency, Starship, put idol training \u2013 when talent is honed and new skills developed \u2013 at five to seven years. The aim for these putative stars is to be put alongside others in a manufactured band, and then \u201cdebuted\u201d as a finished product; Monsta X were formed in 2015 after prospective members were whittled down on a reality show called No.Mercy. \u201cKorean entertainment is one of the hardest jobs out there,\u201d say Suh and Shim. \u201cTrainees are cast from the street and auditions, and learn there are guidelines, and things they need to give up. Everyone is running towards the same goal: debuting.\u201d No trainee is guaranteed a debut and Shownu switched agencies (\u201cIt was slightly painful\u201d) to give himself the best chance of being picked for a group. Each agency sets its own rules, but mobile phones or romantic relationships are forbidden as standard; Monsta X say they relinquished their phones as trainees and for nearly two years after their debut. Minhyuk, 24, saw it as an \u201cinconvenience\u201d, and Hyungwon, also 24, a self-proclaimed introvert with pink hair and a wry sense of humour, says only now does he understand Starship\u2019s intentions in removing outside distractions. But Jooheon, 23, recalls he felt \u201cwalled in during training. There was no freedom. At least when you debut, you experience new things.\u201d Their early, aggressive-sounding singles, Trespass and Rush, brought a solid fanbase, known as Monbebe. They shower Monsta X with clothes, toys, snacks and letters before shows and at album signings, where fans talk with each member, often holding hands with their favourite. To the cynical, it may be a genius marketing ploy but these meetings develop an emotionally symbiotic bond unique to K-pop \u2013 in a tough industry, the fans are, says I.M, a \u201csource of strength\u201d. The youngest at 22, I.M has an adult wariness from spending his formative years in front of cameras where the slightest error can bring career-damaging public criticism. \u201cI worry about making mistakes, but I feel being an idol is natural to me,\u201d he says. \u201cDo I like having rules? Sometimes yes, sometimes no, but that\u2019s real life and I\u2019m fine with it.\u201d Starship undeniably rules the Monsta X roost. Idol groups, with few exceptions, have little power, but in recent years a number have begun to exert some creative grip. Monsta X, too, are striving towards a level of autonomy. I.M pens solo material plus his lyrics on their tracks, as does Jooheon, and several of Wonho\u2019s emotive pop songs are Monsta X album cuts.  Jooheon reveals dozens of inspirational phrases on his phone and says he frequently gets by on three hours of sleep. \u201cI feel uneasy if I don\u2019t make one song every day,\u201d he says, yet he and I.M have been able to release only a couple of solo singles. The group live together in a cluttered apartment but each has a small studio where they can create. \u201cI\u2019ll do everything there \u2013 eat, scream, cry, laugh, watch movies. It\u2019s my playground,\u201d Jooheon smiles. This downtime is crucial; an idol\u2019s schedule is back-breaking. Interviews, radio, variety TV, fan meetings and music shows make for 18-hour days. There is no off-switch once they are beyond the safety of their dressing room but there\u2019s a family atmosphere within those confines; they cheerfully eat together, banter noisily and rest when possible \u2013 Wonho dozes despite hairdryers blasting around him, Minhyuk sleeps so deeply it takes five minutes to wake him. \u201cThe workload can sometimes be too much but we need to grow. It\u2019s good to be busy,\u201d says Wonho. Kihyun, laughing, says: \u201cIt\u2019s our third year. This is in my bones.\u201d Fans call him Monsta X\u2019s \u201cmom\u201d, although he refers to himself as the \u201cpolice, keeping Monsta X within the boundaries\u201d. But he is happy. \u201cI\u2019m doing something I love, I\u2019m earning money and I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019ve sacrificed a lot.\u201d For others, idol life is challenging. \u201cI used to like being around people, but now I need space,\u201d says Hyungwon. Minhyuk is a ball of a warm energy but beneath that is a poignancy. \u201cI\u2019m not an idol for fame, I just like to perform,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t like going outside because I don\u2019t like people gossiping, so it\u2019s been almost two years since I went drinking with friends. Sometimes I\u2019m lonely.\u201d Even in the wake of Jonghyun\u2019s suicide, mental health problems in South Korea aren\u2019t always dealt with correctly or understood by either industry or the public, but Kihyun says it\u2019s better than it was. \u201cWhen artists say they\u2019re going to rest, the reaction is: \u2018Please rest before it gets worse.\u2019\u201d Starship\u2019s Shim says they \u201cmonitor the mental health of all trainees and idols. If we feel like they\u2019re emotionally having a hard time, we\u2019ll suggest they see a therapist or work with them to figure out how to make them better.\u201d Most successful K-pop groups will exist for five to seven years, and idols often head into presenting or acting, with some finding solo success. But male groups face South Korea\u2019s compulsory two-year military service and the threat of career decline on return to civilian life. As a result, Shownu has adopted a day-by-day approach for Monsta X. \u201cI used to think: would I be able to make a living from this?\u201d he says. \u201cThere were teams that debuted at the same time as us but we weren\u2019t going at the same pace. Now I feel like I shouldn\u2019t be pressured \u2013 it\u2019s more about longevity as a group.\u201d After their upcoming, sold out world tour, Monsta X may well have another release before the end of 2018. If they had full control what would they create? Minhyuk quickly replies with \u201csomething like Trespass, a banger\u201d. Hyungwon would keep the sexiness of Jealousy but \u201cI\u2019d love to mix it up with a more casual look\u201d, but it\u2019s Shownu who grounds and bolsters them simultaneously. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what song we do,\u201d he says from across the room where he\u2019s been silently observing. \u201cSexy, soft, or strong \u2013 if Monsta X are doing it, it\u2019s our style.\u201d "

            "title": "Grimes: Art Angels review \u2013 renegade seeks a place in pop heaven",
            "content": "Unless you explicitly set out to play authentic bluegrass, for instance, categorisation is the bane of every musician. Hailing from the Montreal digital underground, producer Claire \u201cGrimes\u201d Boucher initially combined impressionistic loops and processed cooing with a penchant for melody. She looked like a renegade \u2013 candy-coloured hair, self-tattooed hands, mountains of gear. But in the circles into which her first two albums \u2013 2010\u2019s Geidi Primes and Halfaxa (also 2010) \u2013 streamed, her vestigial pop sensibility was an apostasy to be downplayed. Since her third and most realised album, 2012\u2019s Visions, snowballed into an alternative hit, Boucher\u2019s technical expertise has grown exponentially. She is now managed by Roc Nation, the stable where Jay Z developed Rihanna. Having taught herself electronic production, Grimes has mastered guitar, ukulele and violin. Most significantly, her pop ear has emerged from under very fat headphones. This presents a quandary. Is Art Angels \u2013 Grimes\u2019s long-delayed fourth record \u2013 to be judged alongside your Gazelle Twins, or your Lady Gagas? Art Angels reveals itself to be an idiosyncratic pop album \u2013 replete with cheery hooks, blithe melodies, K-pop nods, 80s sounds, guitars, and much greater structure, where before Grimes artily meandered. It is strikingly original, a kaleidoscopically minded Grimes-authored record, rather than a product buffed by committee. Simultaneously, though, it is an echo chamber in a hall of mirrors, wearing all sorts of peer references on its sleeve, even as Grimes\u2019s own authorial voice remains uppermost. Opening with piano and strings, Laughing and Not Being Normal waves to Joanna Newsom. Boucher\u2019s top-of-the-range vocal tells us Grimes is still playing with her instrument, a cartoonishly feminised coo; one of the consistent trademarks of her work. The terrific California is Grimes\u2019s version of Taylor Swift\u2019s Welcome to New York. Boucher moved from Montreal to rural Squamish, British Columbia, to LA, marking an acceptance of her more commercial new role. But unlike with Swift, California is racked and bittersweet \u2013 there\u2019s a great line about \u201ccommodifying all the pain\u201d. Grimes foresees the sea rising up and drowning her. The excellent Scream, which features Taiwanese rapper Aristophanes, is Grimes out-MIA-ing MIA as a hard-hitting global beatmaker. Venus Fly, which features the ArchAndroid herself, Janelle Monae, is hybridised R&B, with carnivorous bass, club-ready breakdowns and an \u201call cool girls together\u201d vibe. This stellar opening run climaxes with Kill V. Maim, with its Depeche Mode keyboard line, segueing into a guitar hook. Eventually, it turns into a bratty chant-along whose pre-chorus simultaneously recalls Gucci Gucci by Kreayshawn and Bikini Kill; as I write, Lady Gaga is in all likelihood screaming at someone to get that chorus now, or something very like it. \u201cI\u2019m only a man/ Do what I can,\u201d Boucher sings, a transgender chipmunk with hidden fangs. Piano ballads? Sure. Easily is a love song that swings like the 90s, a saccharine-sweet tune that hides some unexpectedly fine sonic detailing \u2013 a little \u201csquip\u201d noise middle-eight, followed by subtly inventive subjunctive musical clauses. Packed as it is with all this goodness, Art Angels fails to comprehensively blow your mind. Ultimately, Grimes has not reinvented the pop wheel, she\u2019s just driven it off road a little. By Butterfly, the closing track, all trace of the old, weird Grimes seems lost. She tops off her pulsating club-pop with a girly vocal that\u2019s just a girlish vocal, rather than a deconstruction of girlish vocals. \u201cI\u2019ll never be your dream girl,\u201d Boucher sings, as though to pre-empt the point.

            "content": "K-pop fans around the world have joined forces to drown out online opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, flooding social media with videos and images of their favourite artists alongside the #WhiteLivesMatter hashtag and other racist content. While their collective action meant the hashtag, as well as #WhiteOutWednesday and #BlueLivesMatter were trending in the top 10 on Twitter in the US earlier this week, the accompanying messages and attachments were emphatically off-message. Posts from K-pop stans \u2013 slang for obsessive fans \u2013 came with anti-racist messages and video footage of artists including the boy band phenomenon BTS and the rapper Ryujin. The social media bombardment saw K-pop fans commandeer rightwing and pro-Donald Trump hashtags to drown out racist and offensive posts, including criticism of protests in the US against the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis last week. Instead of revealing opposition to the Black Lives Matter movement, clicking on #WhiteLivesMatter revealed thousands of messages of support for protests that have rocked the US for almost two weeks. Followers of South Korea\u2019s most successful cultural export had already used their organisational skills to sabotage a request by the Dallas police department for video evidence of illegal activity during last weekend\u2019s protests. The barrage of videos of singers, gaming clips and even anime GIFs apparently overloaded iWatch Dallas, forcing the city\u2019s police department to announce it was temporarily removing the app \u201cdue to technical difficulties\u201d. Some users later \u201cinvaded\u201d other hashtags, including #AllLivesMatter and #ExposeAntifa, an attempt to discredit the anti-fascist movement. Their efforts were applauded by other internet activists, with the hacktivist collective Anonymous tweeting: \u201cRespect out to the Kpop Stans\u201d. As their fans mocked the online far right, BTS made a rare foray into politics, voicing solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cWe stand against racial discrimination. We condemn violence. You, I and we all have the right to be respected. We will stand together. #BlackLivesMatter,\u201d the band told their 26 million followers on Twitter. "

            "content": "A Brazilian novel first published more than 40 years ago has unexpectedly become a highly sought-after read, after the Korean pop star IU was accused of sexualising the story of its five-year-old protagonist in one of her songs. Jos\u00e9 Mauro de Vasconcelos\u2019s My Sweet Orange Tree, first published in Portuguese in 1968 and in English in 1970, is set in Rio de Janeiro and follows the life of the boy Zeze, as he gets up to mischief and is mistreated. \u201cEveryone beats him. If you look softhearted he will tell you it\u2019s revolting the way they beat on a little kid. Can you believe him when he says he\u2019s only six? No! The boy is a liar. He is five years old,\u201d runs the copy on the first UK edition.  My Sweet Orange Tree has been out of print in English for years, but Abebooks.com has reported that the novel became its most searched-for title late last week after controversy enveloped IU\u2019s pop song Zeze, which is based on the story. The bookseller\u2019s Richard Davies said that My Sweet Orange Tree was \u201ca much-loved book in South Korea and often studied in schools\u201d. According to the Korea Times, the book\u2019s Korean publisher has issued a statement saying that: \u201cWe regret the way the five-year-old character is portrayed as a sexual object.\u201d  The paper quotes lines from IU\u2019s song which run: \u201cZeze, come on up the tree quick and kiss the leaves, don\u2019t be naughty and don\u2019t hurt the tree, come up the tree and get the youngest leaf \u2026 you are innocent but shrewd, transparent but dirty and there is no way of knowing what\u2019s living inside.\u201d IU has since issued an apology, translated by the K-pop Herald, in which she describes My Sweet Orange Tree as a \u201ctreasured book\u201d, and says: \u201cI swear I did not write the lyrics to sexualise a five-year-old child. The Zeze in my song is a third-party fictional creation taken from the motif in the original novel.\u201d She goes on to apologise, writing: \u201cHowever, after listening to the opinions of those who have listened to the song, I came to realise that its contents could have given offence and even caused some to grieve. I am wholly responsible for my immature handling of things as a lyricist.\u201d "

            "title": "Korean pop: can 'baddest female' CL topple the divas of the West?",
            "content": "A harrowing note left by the K-pop singer Kim Jong-hyun, who has died in a suspected suicide, has highlighted the pressures facing young people in South Korea\u2019s intensely competitive entertainment industry. Kim, the lead singer of the boy band SHINee, died in hospital in Seoul on Monday after he was found unconscious in his apartment. Better known as Jonghyun, he had attracted a huge following in his native country and across Asia both as a band member and solo artist, and was among the most marketable figures in K-pop, South Korea\u2019s most successful cultural export. Over the past decade, SHINee, Super Junior, Girls\u2019 Generation and other bands have been the driving force behind the Hallyu Wave that has helped South Korean films, music and TV dramas establish loyal followings in Asia and Europe.  However, in a note made public a day after his death, the 27-year-old had said he felt \u201cbroken from inside\u201d. \u201cThe depression that gnawed on me slowly has finally engulfed me entirely,\u201d Kim wrote, adding that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t defeat it any more\u201d. His friend the singer Nine9 released the note on her Instagram account, saying he had asked her to make it public in the event of his death. \u201cI was so alone,\u201d Kim continued. \u201cThe act of ending is difficult. I\u2019ve lived until now because of that difficulty. Please tell me I did a good job.\u201d He ended the message: \u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard. You\u2019ve really gone through a lot. Goodbye.\u201d K-pop stars are subjected to severe competition and years of training, with every aspect of their lives \u2013 from their musical style and fashion to diet and even mobile phone use \u2013 dictated by powerful management agencies. This video has been removed. This could be because it launched early, our rights have expired, there was a legal issue, or for another reason. Like their Japanese counterparts, many are forced to forgo romantic relationships to maintain the wholesome image crafted by their industry handlers. In Kim, many fans saw a supremely talented singer and dancer who had managed to avoid the hazards, such as alcohol and drugs, that had destroyed the careers of some of his peers. The shock felt among his fans worldwide was compounded by the fact that he appeared happy and at ease with himself during public appearances only days before his death. But in echoes of his longer note, he had sought what appeared to be assurances about his achievements from his sister in text messages he sent on Monday. \u201cThis is my last farewell,\u201d he told her. \u201cPlease let me go and say I did a good job.\u201d  The relentless pressure to achieve can be found in every sector of South Korean society, from its highly competitive education system to a corporate culture that has little tolerance for failure \u2013 factors that experts say contribute to the highest suicide rate in the industrialised world. Several high-profile figures, including the country\u2019s former president Roh Moo-hyun, as well as business executives, have killed themselves in recent years. In 2009, the actor Park Jin-hee wrote a master\u2019s degree paper in which she said 40% of South Korea\u2019s actors had considered suicide at least once due to a lack of privacy, online bullying, unstable incomes and the fear that their talents were not appreciated by the industry or the public. Some of the hundreds of fans paying their respects on Tuesday at the hospital where Kim died spoke of the intolerable pressures that can accompany stardom in South Korea. \u201cI came here to say my last farewell \u2026 since we fans apparently couldn\u2019t be there for him when he needed help most,\u201d 19-year-old Jung Min-kyung told AFP. \u201cI think our country has very high expectations of celebrities.\u201d The man tasked with revamping the iconic Moonman statue for this year\u2019s MTV VMAs, Moschino\u2019s creative director Jeremy Scott could have taken any of pop\u2019s top tier as his date to the world-famous music ceremony: his muses include Rihanna, Katy Perry and Gaga. Instead, Scott chose South Korean singer and rapper CL. The self-styled \u201cbaddest bitch\u201d is one of K-pop\u2019s biggest stars, and \u2013 with the help of Scott and producers such as Diplo \u2013 is attempting to bring the delirious Technicolor of Korean pop to the wider world. K-pop is flash and slick, all futuristic swirls of DayGlo pop and hip-hop mixed with bootcamp levels of precision-tooled choreography. So far \u2013 outside Asia, at least \u2013 its charms have struggled to move beyond internet forums, but there are signs things are shifting, with such impeccably coiffured bands as Big Bang taking their ludicrous live spectacles to Europe\u2019s arenas, a step beyond one-hit wonder Psy. CL seems best placed to be the person to take K-pop properly mainstream though. For one, she\u2019s always felt like an anomaly: a bold and brash personality in a world of high-gloss uniformity, Diplo has called her the Nicki Minaj of K-pop. \u201cHer attitude makes her a more international artist,\u201d agrees Billboard\u2019s K-pop columnist Jeff Benjamin. \u201cShe has a more fearless mindset when it comes to her career that\u2019s not seen in most K-pop stars.\u201d  In 2013, this fearlessness prompted her to step away from 2NE1, one of Korea\u2019s biggest girl bands, with her solo track The Baddest Female, a clattering ego massage that channelled Atlanta hip-hop. A year later, she signed with Justin Bieber\u2019s manager Scooter Braun, the man responsible for breaking Gangnam Style, while a chiefly English-language and globally distributed album will follow her forthcoming EP on Diplo\u2019s Mad Decent label. One of the things that sets CL apart from her K-pop affiliates is her self-assuredness. \u201cI don\u2019t think about myself as the representative for all Korean artists,\u201d she says. \u201cMy goal is to make good music and to keep doing what I love.\u201d Key to her success is how CL has grasped that the manicured K-pop approach needs to blend with the grittier, more risqu\u00e9 experimentalism of Rihanna and Miley Cyrus. Diplo\u2019s low-slung Doctor Pepper sees her hold her own against Riff Raff and OG Maco, while her forthcoming EP opens with the glitchy banger Hello Bitches, her scattergun flow namechecking \u201cprivate jets\u201d and \u201cdiamonds in my grill\u201d. While that may seem like compromising or blending in, it\u2019s also about global artists stepping up and being unafraid to fight it out with the big US guns. For too long, K-pop artists have been happy to remain a niche, almost novelty, proposition. Not CL. Asked recently what Braun\u2019s advice for world domination was, CL replied, \u201cbe a boss-ass bitch\u201d. She\u2019s ready. CL\u2019s debut EP will be released this autumn on Mad Decent  "

            "content": " As students wait outside an exam room in Seoul\u2019s affluent Gangnam district, the air is tense. A girl in a school uniform rocks a guitar back and forth in her hands next to a boy who stares nervously into his fringe. Another girl sitting on a nearby bench adjusts her crop top. But in a neighbourhood filled with English and maths crammers, this is no normal exam room. This is a K-pop training academy, where dozens of students between the ages of 12 and 26 line up for their chance to audition for a visiting entertainment scout. Kevin Lee is among this group of hopefuls. At 19, he has already moonlighted as a backup dancer for the phenomenally successful K-pop group BTS. He estimates that he has attended more than 50 K-pop auditions over the past four years. But this hasn\u2019t been enough. Concerned about his age \u2013 most entertainment companies recruit school-aged trainees \u2013 Lee says he will give up on his dream if he isn\u2019t accepted into a major entertainment company this year. \u201cIt\u2019s hard not to think about failure,\u201d he says. \u201cThey say at 17 you have a 50% chance of becoming a trainee. I\u2019m already 19 so my chances are slim.\u201d Lee is not alone \u2013 for many young Koreans K-pop is a desirable career choice and there are many academies like this one . Who wouldn\u2019t want to be a part of this pop behemoth that has become South Korea\u2019s best-known cultural export? It\u2019s an industry worth $5bn; BTS alone sold more albums than Taylor Swift, Billie Eilish and Ariana Grande last year. But something is very wrong inside K-pop, and it points to a deeper malaise throughout South Korea. There has been a spate of suicides and high-profile sex scandals involving K-pop stars in recent times. At the height of their fame, these men and women seem to have buckled under the strain, unable to live up to the demands placed on them to be polished, picture-perfect ambassadors of this effervescent pop music. Kim Jong-hyun, 27, a member of SHINee, took his own life in 2017 after speaking about the intense pressures brought on by success. In March 2019, several male K-pop stars, including Seungri, a member of boyband Big Bang, Choi Jong-hoon, a former member of FT Island, and singer-songwriter Jung Joon-young were implicated in a spycam sexual abuse scandal, after Jung shared videos of women in a group chat. The case resulted in five- and six-year prison sentences for them respectively for their roles in gang raping drunk, unconscious women. Allegations also arose over Seungri\u2019s ties to Burning Sun, a nightclub he founded where date-rape and sexual assault allegedly took place. Then in October last year, Sulli, 25, a former member of the girl group f(x) killed herself. A month later, Goo Hara, 28, a former member of the group Kara and a close friend of Sulli, also took her own life. It soon emerged that both women had been harassed online for months, if not years. Sulli had experienced sexist abuse and cyber-bullying from thousands of faceless male \u201canti-fans\u201d (online haters) over her conduct and appearance. Goo had been hounded over a court case with an ex-boyfriend over a sex tape that had allegedly been filmed without her consent. According to Mano Lee, a Seoul-based K-pop columnist, the sexism and misogyny that female stars face is a symptom of the way women are treated in wider society. \u201cA lot of Korean women can relate to the issues that female celebrities deal with. They have experienced it themselves. While many feel unsafe due to the pervasiveness of molka, gender-based violence and victim-shaming,\u201d she says. Molka \u2013 from mollae, Korean for secret, and ka for camera \u2013 means the illicit filming of women. There has been widespread outrage over the spycam epidemic. In 2018, almost 6,800 cases of hidden camera crimes were reported to the supreme prosecutors\u2019 office. In some cases, cameras were hidden in women\u2019s public toilets and motel rooms, others involved the filming and sharing of videos of women taken by partners and former partners. The revelations of the Jung Joon-young spycam scandal provoked fury across the nation. \u201cK-pop tries to present a cleansed image of male stars as being kind, generous, that they are unlike patriarchal, sexist and unstylish Korean men,\u201d says John Lie, a sociology professor at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cThe shock came because of the gulf between the illusion and the reality.\u201d Yet, though K-pop stars are expected to live up to all but impossible standards, many might say that the pressure to be perfect is also intense for ordinary Koreans \u2013 K-pop simply takes what\u2019s there in wider society and intensifies it. \u201cIn order to get ahead in Korea, you have to step on someone else,\u201d says Justin Shin, a Seoul-based fashion photographer who works closely with K-pop idols. \u201cIt\u2019s like this from kindergarten, you have to leap ahead of all the other kids. All their lives, Koreans are exposed to competition \u2013 constantly being tested, evaluated and scored over their actions and academic achievements. It\u2019s super-competitive.\u201d For most South Koreans, success means having the right \u201cspecs\u201d or specifications: everyone is judged in terms of their family background, level of education, job title, wealth and appearance. \u201cIf you went to a great school, or you have a nice body that you worked hard to cultivate, or if you have an expensive foreign car \u2013 these are all different forms of specs,\u201d says Michael Hurt, a sociologist at the University of Seoul. For women in particular, having the right specs means being attractive and excelling at homemaking. But, says Shin Gi-wook, professor of sociology at Stanford University, the natural consequences of such a highly competitive society are jealousy and bullying: \u201cThose who are more successful than others easily become the centre of gossip and rumours,\u201d he says. In Sulli and Goo\u2019s cases, the public shaming they experienced can be seen as a more extreme example of the scrutiny and criticism all Korean women are subjected to. Sulli, whose real name was Choi Jin-ri, was among the few K-pop stars who supported the nation\u2019s feminist \u201cno bra\u201d movement, daring to challenge Korean society\u2019s strict female dress codes. For this, as well as for her past relationship with Choiza, a fellow musician 14 years her senior, which began when she was 19, Sulli became the target of online abuse \u2013 K-pop stars are expected to stay single for years and not date during their teens. Sulli tried to address her detractors by appearing on a TV talk show about the cyber-bullying that celebrities face, telling viewers, \u201cMy life is actually empty. I feel like I\u2019m lying to everyone by pretending to be happy on the outside.\u201d \u201cSo many celebrities have taken their lives because of this kind of criticism,\u201d says one Korean jewellery designer who asked not to be named, and who says he knew Sulli for many years. He explains that another K-pop star he works with once received a bloody dagger in the mail \u201cwith real blood\u201d and that receiving angry threats and letters was normal for many K-pop idols. Like Sulli, Goo had been the target of severe online bullying since late 2018, when she entered a court battle against Choi Jong-bum, an ex-boyfriend who she claimed had threatened to release a sex video allegedly filmed without her consent. Choi was later acquitted and although the video was never released, Goo suffered from the events and her all-important K-pop image was badly damaged. \u201cKorean celebrities who take their lives tend to be women, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an accident,\u201d says Hurt. \u201cI think there\u2019s a kind of precariousness that female stars have to live with that men don\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s certainly true that male K-pop stars don\u2019t have to worry about wearing the wrong suit, for instance, while, for female stars, the risks of deviating even slightly from strict expectations about appearance are dire. \u201cIf you\u2019re a woman your career can always end in an instant,\u201d says Hurt. \u201cYou can be a top star but they\u2019ll come after you with pitchforks. These women are stars, yet society is stacked against them. When police are coming at you, turning a victim into victimiser, it seems like a man can attack a female idol who has top lawyers and a big entertainment company behind her and still he has more protection.\u201d Back at the Seoul academy, Kim Tae-heon, 21, waits for his audition. Kim grew up in South Gyeongsang province in the rural southern region of the country. He moved to Seoul to attend the school two years ago and spends up to nine hours every day practising his singing, dancing and acting skills at the academy. \u201cBesides the obvious performance skills, you need a strong, stable mind to be able to do this,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve seen people disappear along the way \u2013 at least six out of 10 will give up when they realise there are so many others who are better at this.\u201d For Kim, despite the intense competition, there is nothing else he could see himself doing. \u201cSince I was young, I\u2019ve always enjoyed being onstage. At school I would volunteer to sing or dance in front of others. It\u2019s my joy in life.\u201d According to the academy\u2019s founder, 386 former students \u2013 including Hye Bin from Momoland and Song Min-ho from Winner \u2013 have been recruited by major K-pop firms over the past five years. However, he admits the success rate is still very low. \u201cOnly 5-10% of our students make it past auditions . . .I find the ones who are successful are the ones who practise all day. I see them at the academy all the time.\u201d He says that around 40% of current students live outside Seoul. Many travel for hours every week by train or bus to get to and from the school, where they pay up to KRW600,000 (\u00a3400) a month for the opportunity to become an idol. According to him, this work ethic is the backbone of K-pop \u201cThe reason K-pop became so successful was because of its intense training system\u2026 And if these companies want to continue innovating the industry, they need to upgrade the training system,\u201d he says. \u201cThese days, training is even longer and harder. But most of the better entertainment companies try to make this process as enjoyable as they can for trainees.\u201d Even for those who graduate to stardom, the hard work doesn\u2019t end. Kevin Lee realised this while working behind the scenes with BTS. \u201cWhen we went to dance practice for their shows, they\u2019d always be arriving straight from their tours in other countries,\u201d he says. \u201cAs soon as they get back they would go to practise for seven hours a day. They don\u2019t rest, they work hard and that\u2019s why they are able to achieve this level of success.\u201d While some criticism regarding K-pop\u2019s gruelling training process is valid, the founder of the academy says South Koreans study just as much to pass suneung, the country\u2019s national university entrance exam, and work as hard at entering other careers, such as the civil service and legal professions. \u201cK-pop is portrayed as this factory-like industry, but I question this view, because everyone in Korea is forced to study for years. If anything, people who are training to become idols are training for something they actually want to become,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are living every day with a purpose and with a dream. And there\u2019s freedom in that.\u201d Many, however, see things differently. The demanding nature of the industry can mean signing contracts that can leave stars feeling trapped. According to K-pop star Prince Mak, contracts can lock you in for up to 15 years, and the term doesn\u2019t begin to count down until you are deemed a success, which can lock you in for years beyond the top line, while you are trained. The financial rewards are also limited. Prince Mak told SBS PopAsia radio that K-pop stars don\u2019t earn very much. The most common profit ratios are either 80% to the company and 20% to the artist, or 90% to the company and 10% to the artist. If you are in a group, the figures are worse still because the money is split between band members. Most stars are obliged to repay the cost of their training to their record companies. So, while to their fans, it looks as if many K-pop stars are wealthy and independent, many are contractually bound employees with little personal freedom. Add to that the pressures of maintaining impossibly high standards of appearance and behaviour, and the tragedies of Sulli and Goo begin to seem less like a surprise. In the wake of their deaths, the South Korean government discussed passing a new bill that would introduce cyber-bullying education at schools and workplaces. However, many believe policy alone is no solution, and the cause goes straight to the heart of societal expectations. \u201cK-pop has gone international and it brings pride to the country, but there\u2019s this cultural programme of gender and social norms that\u2019s impossible to win,\u201d says Hurt. \u201cYou\u2019d have to really thread a needle in a particular and perfect way, and I think that\u2019s the thing about these K-pop stars going out into the spotlight\u2026 They can\u2019t really win.\u201d Additional reporting by David Lee "

            "title": "K-pop singer Jonghyun's death turns spotlight on pressures of stardom",
            "content": "A harrowing note left by the K-pop singer Kim Jong-hyun, who has died in a suspected suicide, has highlighted the pressures facing young people in South Korea\u2019s intensely competitive entertainment industry. Kim, the lead singer of the boy band SHINee, died in hospital in Seoul on Monday after he was found unconscious in his apartment. Better known as Jonghyun, he had attracted a huge following in his native country and across Asia both as a band member and solo artist, and was among the most marketable figures in K-pop, South Korea\u2019s most successful cultural export. Over the past decade, SHINee, Super Junior, Girls\u2019 Generation and other bands have been the driving force behind the Hallyu Wave that has helped South Korean films, music and TV dramas establish loyal followings in Asia and Europe.  However, in a note made public a day after his death, the 27-year-old had said he felt \u201cbroken from inside\u201d. \u201cThe depression that gnawed on me slowly has finally engulfed me entirely,\u201d Kim wrote, adding that he \u201ccouldn\u2019t defeat it any more\u201d. His friend the singer Nine9 released the note on her Instagram account, saying he had asked her to make it public in the event of his death. \u201cI was so alone,\u201d Kim continued. \u201cThe act of ending is difficult. I\u2019ve lived until now because of that difficulty. Please tell me I did a good job.\u201d He ended the message: \u201cYou\u2019ve worked hard. You\u2019ve really gone through a lot. Goodbye.\u201d K-pop stars are subjected to severe competition and years of training, with every aspect of their lives \u2013 from their musical style and fashion to diet and even mobile phone use \u2013 dictated by powerful management agencies. This video has been removed. This could be because it launched early, our rights have expired, there was a legal issue, or for another reason. Like their Japanese counterparts, many are forced to forgo romantic relationships to maintain the wholesome image crafted by their industry handlers. In Kim, many fans saw a supremely talented singer and dancer who had managed to avoid the hazards, such as alcohol and drugs, that had destroyed the careers of some of his peers. The shock felt among his fans worldwide was compounded by the fact that he appeared happy and at ease with himself during public appearances only days before his death. But in echoes of his longer note, he had sought what appeared to be assurances about his achievements from his sister in text messages he sent on Monday. \u201cThis is my last farewell,\u201d he told her. \u201cPlease let me go and say I did a good job.\u201d  The relentless pressure to achieve can be found in every sector of South Korean society, from its highly competitive education system to a corporate culture that has little tolerance for failure \u2013 factors that experts say contribute to the highest suicide rate in the industrialised world. Several high-profile figures, including the country\u2019s former president Roh Moo-hyun, as well as business executives, have killed themselves in recent years. In 2009, the actor Park Jin-hee wrote a master\u2019s degree paper in which she said 40% of South Korea\u2019s actors had considered suicide at least once due to a lack of privacy, online bullying, unstable incomes and the fear that their talents were not appreciated by the industry or the public. Some of the hundreds of fans paying their respects on Tuesday at the hospital where Kim died spoke of the intolerable pressures that can accompany stardom in South Korea. \u201cI came here to say my last farewell \u2026 since we fans apparently couldn\u2019t be there for him when he needed help most,\u201d 19-year-old Jung Min-kyung told AFP. \u201cI think our country has very high expectations of celebrities.\u201d "

            "title": "K-pop video director charged in South Korean corruption scandal",
            "content": "A prominent K-pop music video director has been charged as part of a corruption scandal rocking South Korea and engulfing the country\u2019s president, Park Geun-hye. Prosecutors claim Cha Eun-taek, who has worked with Gangnam Style star Psy and the boy band Big Bang, used his ties to a secret confidante of Park to win lucrative projects from state agencies and private firms. That confidante \u2013 Choi Soon-sil \u2013 has been labelled Park\u2019s \u00e9minence grise and is accused of using her close relationship with the president to extract more than $60m (\u00a348m) from top companies including Samsung. Prosecutors say Park ordered her former economic adviser to help Cha pressure officials and private firms so that he would win contracts. Cha, 46, has been charged with abuse of power, coercion and embezzlement, and has becomes the latest public figure to be embroiled in the snowballing scandal. Choi, 60, is accused of meddling in a wide range of state affairs including the country\u2019s preparations for the 2018 Winter Olympics.  Prosecutors last week formally charged her with abuse of power and coercion, saying Park was a \u201cco-culprit\u201d who had colluded with Choi to strongarm top firms into giving cash to non-profit foundations the latter controlled. Park has rejected a series of requests from prosecutors to answer their questions. As a sitting president, Park cannot be charged with a criminal offence except insurrection or treason, but she can be investigated and potentially charged once her term is over. She is the first South Korean president to become a criminal suspect while in office.  Park is faced with growing public calls to resign and a push by lawmakers to impeach her, with her job approval ratings diving to record lows of 4%. Hundreds of thousands of South Koreans have taken to the streets in recent weeks to call for her to step down, with organisers claiming the latest rally on Saturday in Seoul drew 1.5 million people.

            "title": "Kim Jong-hyun: SHINee star dies amid an unforgiving K-pop industry",
            "content": "The death of Kim Jong-hyun of South Korean boyband SHINee marks, if not definitely the end, then a crushing blow to one of the country\u2019s most enduring pop outfits. With their earnest, keeningly romantic songs, paired with immaculate choreography, SHINee marked the apotheosis of their country\u2019s boyband craft. While in the west there have only been a handful of successful boybands in recent years, in Korea and Japan \u2013 where SHINee also had a huge following, leading to a string of Japanese-language albums \u2013 the appetite for ultra-emotional ballads and energetic dance tracks, performed by impossibly beautiful and well-drilled young men, is apparently insatiable. K-pop fandom is obsessive, and fans openly rank their favourite members; bands are sometimes created as the result of reality TV competitions, an example being new eight-piece IN2IT, freshly minted from a 27-strong boyband called Boys24 being whittled down. SHINee are part of a generation who have had this fandom weaponised by social media \u2013 the most tweeted-about celebrities on Twitter worldwide in 2017 were not Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian or Justin Bieber, but Korean boyband BTS.  To western eyes, some of SHINee\u2019s aesthetics may seem corny. Anglophone boybands from the Simon Cowell stable, such as One Direction and now Rak-Su and Pretty Much, are less given to synchronised dance moves and more to impetuous boisterousness. Not so SHINee, whose smooth, nimble-shouldered take on hip-hop dance is reminiscent of 1990s US giants such as Backstreet Boys and N\u2019Sync. Their songs, meanwhile, cleave to pretty safe boyband production staples: predominantly light, fluffy disco-funk tracks, with occasional forays into gnarly pop-rock and gauzy alt-R&B. But even if their choreography and songcraft has precedent, their fashion sense is absolutely contemporary. Often shaped by designer Ha Sang Beg, sharp-edged dance tracks are met with even sharper tailoring, while more relaxed songs prompt gloriously clashing streetwear. The band formed in 2008, manufactured by Korean music industry behemoth SM Entertainment, the company behind successes such as girl band Girls Generation, solo singers Kangta and BoA, and, of course, numerous other boybands: TVXQ!, Super Junior, HOT and more. Even accounting for a recent break, as member Taemin released a solo record, SHINee are a rare case of a band reaching a decade in the business; K- and J-pop can have a ruthless, disposable feel. The managers of Japanese girl band AKB48 \u2013 whose members number up to 130 and are voted in and out by the public \u2013 were criticised in 2013 after one member, Minami Minegishi, filmed herself shaving her head in penitence for spending a night with her boyfriend, contravening a no-dating rule for the group\u2019s members. Artists in both territories are often signed up to draconian contracts in their early teens, keeping them tied to specific management companies, such as SM Entertainment. They train in a competitive environment alongside other potential stars, with only the best \u201cidols\u201d making it into the manufactured bands. As well as the aforementioned dating rules, band members\u2019 diets are closely monitored. In 2012, girl group Nine Muses revealed their \u201cpaper cup diet\u201d, where their meals had to fit inside a tiny paper cup. After TVXQ! took their management company to court for keeping them in a 13-year contract, a 2008 ruling brought in more standardised contracts and a seven-year limit to their length. But there are arguments that the rules don\u2019t go far enough and can be circumvented \u2013 one agency spokesperson told the Korea Times that only 40% of management agencies use the standardised contracts, leaving musicians open to exploitation.  Even under standard contracts, if a band member wants to leave early, they have to pay the company a fee based on projected profits for the remainder of the contract. Two Chinese members of SM-managed K-pop boy band EXO left the group in 2014, citing wage disputes and brutal work schedules; EXO\u2019s band members have been made to perform during illness and dance while recovering from injury. The threat of conscription to the army is another stress \u2013 even one of the country\u2019s biggest stars, G-Dragon, has been called up and will begin in 2018, knocking a two-year hole in his music career. The lockstep perfection of SHINee\u2019s dance routines is undeniably thrilling \u2013 but there is something troubling about them too, knowing that only the absolute best will be tolerated. Kim Jong-hyun\u2019s death is currently being treated as a suicide, after he sent his sister a note via text message. The reasons for his death are not yet clear, but given his history in a Hunger Games-like musical culture where only the strongest survive, one line from it is chilling: \u201cTell me I did well.\u201d "

            "content": "In December, K-pop star Jonghyun, from boyband the Shinee, was found dead aged 27 \u2013 sparking a fierce debate about the pressures on the young people in the country\u2019s music industry, as well as an outpouring of love from fans. A posthumous album, Poet | Artist, was released this month, and it\u2019s no mere cash-in \u2013 it shows how flexible Jonghyun was, hopping between laidback R&B, ballads and forthright dance tracks, and delivering some very credible deep house vocals on Rewind. On Only One You Need, though, he cleaves to his core style: earnest, anthemic pop. The language barrier dissolves as he swaps into English for the chorus, but the keenness of his feeling means you understand him throughout. Kylie recorded her forthcoming album in Nashville, and is audibly wearing some Daisy Dukes on this lead-off single. It begins with some front-porch fingerpicking, but this being Kylie, the disco awaits, and it quickly segues into a pumping, outrageously camp chorus. Not since Avicii\u2019s Wake Me Up have the worlds of country and dance-pop collided with such a lack of shame \u2013 and surprising finesse. This young rapper from Northampton has a bug-eyed, acutely agitated flow, his voice lapsing into a raw bleat at its most keenly felt. T N Biscuits features a watery yet funky melody running through crisp, sparse percussion, allowing Slowthai to deliver a constantly unfolding verse worthy of a club freestyle. Last seen playing a sex therapist with a giant insect emerging from his rectum in Flying Lotus\u2019s freaky film Kuso, George Clinton continues to keep with the times. He brings back the Parliament name to remind everyone of his funk credentials, massively underlined by this track\u2019s bulging bassline and tight guitar licks. It drops into a gorgeously mournful middle eight, before Scarface turns up for a languorous guest verse. This Italian producer uses a brilliantly realised bit of sampling \u2013 Notorious BIG cut funkily into little chunks \u2013 to underpin this bumping underground house jam, joined by warm, sad chords and melodic saucepan percussion. Biggie\u2019s funky blurt just before the drop ushers the 4/4 beat back in will have dancers groaning in satisfaction. If 2017 was Peggy Gou\u2019s breakthrough year as a DJ, cropping up everywhere with her box of Italo obscurities, techno rollers and house heaters, then 2018 could mark her breakthrough as a producer \u2013 and indeed vocalist, with this track airing her voice for the first time. Todd Terje-style nu-disco underpins an ever squelchier melody, as Gou delivers a naive yet jaded top line in Korean. A gigantic hard rock anthem from the Bingley band, fronted by Becca McIntyre, who had a long walk back to stardom after sustaining a terrible knee injury (something she discussed in these pages last week). Powered along by a bone-dry drum pattern and churning, seasick guitar lines, McIntyre yelps with canine intensity at the peak of an already peaking chorus.  This Australian trio \u2013 who have been making a stand against sexual assault with a powerful T-shirt campaign \u2013 make a gorgeous, ramshackle jangle, its loveliness enhancing the rawness of the lyrics, in which someone turns her back on being the other woman. As she rides away from the man\u2019s house on her bike, you can almost feel the breeze on your face. Justin Vernon, AKA Bon Iver, is cropping up everywhere at the moment \u2013 not only is he about to start an eight-night residency at London\u2019s Hammersmith Apollo, and is sampled by the aforementioned DJ Koze on his forthcoming album, but also guests on the new one from German electronic duo Mouse on Mars. Vernon\u2019s soulful, ductile croon is threaded through a kind of sumptuous orchestral jazz improvisation. An unlikely but spellbinding collaboration: Greek dub producer Jay Glass Dubs is topped by Leslie Winer, an 80s fashion model who worked for Dior and Valentino before taking a 90-degree turn into underground music. On their EP YMFEES, Winer\u2019s drowsy poetry tumbles over echoing dread until it starts to chaotically feed back on itself. "

But what exactly is in these broadcasts that have so upset fragile relations between the two Koreas?  Radio has been a battleground between North and South Korea since a truce in the Korean war in 1953, with broadcasting and signal-jamming taking place on both sides. The stretch of no-mans-land between the countries has been described as one of the busiest for radio-waves in the world.  The South broadcasts Voice of Freedom radio, one of three stations that transmits to the DPRK, and one of the oldest. \u201cIt usually broadcasts about ethnic homogeneity, the superiority of the South Korean system, and various types of K-pop,\u201d said an insider, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt used to be more stridently [against] North Korea in the past, but since the 1990s it has been trying to describe the reality of democratic society as a more effective means of psychological warfare,\u201d another source said, also anonymously. Broadcasts from the North are said to be more directly bellicose. A South Korean military official told the Seoul-based newspaper Kyunghyang Sinmun that \u201cthe DPRK\u2019s broadcasts against the South deal with slander of the South Korean government, as well as promoting the North Korean regime,\u201d adding that the North\u2019s speakers were old and rusty and sometimes difficult to understand. A source said the North\u2019s main reason for broadcasting was to drown out the Voice of Freedom, adding that the South would in turn increase the volume of its own loudspeakers. Voice of Freedom plays on FM radio in Seoul, as well as shortwave over the border. Its broadcasts include a combination of casual conversation alongside anti-DPRK content, an afternoon\u2019s listening revealed. One day last week it featured defectors talking about their lives in the South, a discussion about how to deal with hot weather and a programme of Buddhist preaching. Well-known journalist Ju Seong-ha, a defector, participated in a segment called Read the Rodong Sinmun Again, analysing North Korea\u2019s state-run newspaper. Ju and the anchor criticised Kim Jong-un\u2019s behaviour, mocking staged photo-ops of him getting off a plane as though he were travelling on a state visit. \u201cNo foreign country will welcome Kim Jong-un, because he is a dictator. Thus, he is playing the king alone, on the red velvet,\u201d Ju said. Other content focussed on human rights abuses in North Korea, a country compared to Nazi Germany in a 2014 UN report. On this occasion, the treatment of South Korean worker Yoo Seong-jin during his illegal four month detention in 2009 was condemned. Between shows, the station broadcasts pop music. Some songs reach back to pre-K-pop days, while others revel in the vibrant, hyper-modern sound that has made helped make South Korea a soft-power superstar.

The South broadcasts Voice of Freedom radio, one of three stations that transmits to the DPRK, and one of the oldest. \u201cIt usually broadcasts about ethnic homogeneity, the superiority of the South Korean system, and various types of K-pop,\u201d said an insider, speaking on condition of anonymity. \u201cIt used to be more stridently [against] North Korea in the past, but since the 1990s it has been trying to describe the reality of democratic society as a more effective means of psychological warfare,\u201d another source said, also anonymously. Broadcasts from the North are said to be more directly bellicose. A South Korean military official told the Seoul-based newspaper Kyunghyang Sinmun that \u201cthe DPRK\u2019s broadcasts against the South deal with slander of the South Korean government, as well as promoting the North Korean regime,\u201d adding that the North\u2019s speakers were old and rusty and sometimes difficult to understand. A source said the North\u2019s main reason for broadcasting was to drown out the Voice of Freedom, adding that the South would in turn increase the volume of its own loudspeakers. Voice of Freedom plays on FM radio in Seoul, as well as shortwave over the border. Its broadcasts include a combination of casual conversation alongside anti-DPRK content, an afternoon\u2019s listening revealed. One day last week it featured defectors talking about their lives in the South, a discussion about how to deal with hot weather and a programme of Buddhist preaching. Well-known journalist Ju Seong-ha, a defector, participated in a segment called Read the Rodong Sinmun Again, analysing North Korea\u2019s state-run newspaper. Ju and the anchor criticised Kim Jong-un\u2019s behaviour, mocking staged photo-ops of him getting off a plane as though he were travelling on a state visit. \u201cNo foreign country will welcome Kim Jong-un, because he is a dictator. Thus, he is playing the king alone, on the red velvet,\u201d Ju said. Other content focussed on human rights abuses in North Korea, a country compared to Nazi Germany in a 2014 UN report. On this occasion, the treatment of South Korean worker Yoo Seong-jin during his illegal four month detention in 2009 was condemned. Between shows, the station broadcasts pop music. Some songs reach back to pre-K-pop days, while others revel in the vibrant, hyper-modern sound that has made helped make South Korea a soft-power superstar. A version of this article originally appeared on NK News Coachella, the most high-profile music festival in the US, has announced its full lineup for 2020. Political rap-rock band Rage Against the Machine headline the Friday of the two-weekend festival in April (each weekend featuring the same lineup), as part of their first tour since 2011. The band, which formed in 1991, released four albums before splitting in 2000. They re-formed in 2007, with their first concert at Coachella that year. Two years later, following a fan campaign, they scored an unlikely UK Christmas No 1 with their expletive-filled track Killing in the Name. Rage Against the Machine, who had announced their Coachella slot in November, will warm up for the festival with three US dates close to the border with Mexico: El Paso, Las Cruces and Phoenix. Weekend 1 is sold out \ud83c\udf34 Register for Weekend 2 presale at https://t.co/x8PRTb12Eh. Presale starts Monday 1/6 at 12pm PT pic.twitter.com/QPRYnJVe9P Headlining on Saturday is the Atlanta rapper Travis Scott, whose three albums have all reached No 3 in the US, the second two at No 1. Scott is known for his psychedelic take on trap music and energetic live shows. Last week he released Jackboys, an EP featuring collaborations with artists from his label, Cactus Jack. Sunday\u2019s headliner is R&B auteur Frank Ocean, playing his first live show since 2017. The high-profile slot suggests Ocean may be planning to release a new full-length project to follow his acclaimed 2016 record Blonde, named the best album of the decade by Pitchfork and the 10th best of the century by the Guardian. Ocean has released several singles since Blonde including Lens, DHL and In My Room, along with a cover of Moon River. Other artists performing at Coachella include rappers 21 Savage, DaBaby, Megan Thee Stallion and Run the Jewels; left-field pop singers Lana Del Rey, Rex Orange County and Daniel Caesar; dance music artists Calvin Harris, Flume and Disclosure; R&B singers Summer Walker, FKA twigs and Ari Lennox; and film and TV composer Danny Elfman. UK artists appearing include Thom Yorke, Marina, Lewis Capaldi, Idles, Sleaford Mods, Slowthai and Fatboy Slim. This year\u2019s Coachella also marks the return of one of the biggest artists in K-pop: boyband Bigbang, who have been on hiatus while members G-Dragon, Taeyang and Daesung completed military service. A fourth member, Seungri, retired from the group and the entertainment industry in March 2019 after he was alleged to have arranged sex workers for clients and investors at a Seoul nightclub. "

            "title": "Grimes live review \u2013 big bass, even bigger hooks",
            "content": "It is only when you witness this much unfettered female joy on stage that you realise how rarely it is that you see it. Grimes\u2019s feral K-pop rave is easily the best thing to be run through a mixing desk this year, maybe longer. It is every kind of awesome. Shrieks greet the atmospheric introductory passage, Laughing and Not Being Normal, that opens Grimes\u2019s most recent album, Art Angels, and her set. Grimes \u2013 Claire Boucher, on her passport \u2013 then lets loose the Japanese-themed melody from Genesis, off her previous album, 2012\u2019s Visions. Flanking her are two fierce dancers, Alison and Linda, who recall the Security of the First World, Public Enemy\u2019s old pseudo-paramilitary helpmeets, crossed with ninjas. Soon, she\u2019s unleashing gut-juddering sub-bass for Realiti, crunchier, and weirder than on record. She starts Flesh Without Blood off conducting the air, strumming a guitar riff and then singing about a false friendship in a bubblegum coo. \u201cGot a doll that looks like you,\u201d she smiles meaningfully. Bittersweet hook after bittersweet hook plays out on her gear. The bass is carnivorously loud; HANA, Boucher\u2019s support act-cum-band member, whacks drum pads and tosses her plaited horsetail around. The tune is huge. Everywhere you look, there are women dancing. That pop music can be done with so much sweet, kaleidoscopic ferocity comes as a shock after a lifetime of regretfully accepting that the dead-eyed Britney version was the only way mainstream pop could work. There is no doubt that Miley Cyrus is having a ball, but you can still just see the marionette strings when she moves. Seeing Grimes tour Art Angels, her fourth and most accessible album (released last November), is like entering a parallel universe, where riot grrrl won the World Cup, where the K-pop-worshipping PC Music scene (Sophie et al) gained control of the means of production, currently hogged by a small cabal of producers who might not have the best interests of pop\u00a0starlets at heart, where Peaches is\u00a0as big as Madonna. Grimes the cult producer used to stay glued conscientiously to her equipment. In her new incarnation, she spends an\u00a0hour bounding dementedly around, head-banging, running back to her workstation to start the next beat, play\u00a0a keyboard line or trigger a sample. The stage set is as cheap as you like, what look like army surplus tarpaulins lit from beneath in lurid pinks and yellows, or strafed by lasers.\u00a0When she\u2019s not singing, Grimes\u00a0cradles the microphone in the\u00a0crook of her neck like a phone, both\u00a0hands feverishly organising the live bits of the show\u2019s playback. And so it goes on, euphorically, menacingly, with Grimes mixing what she calls \u201cdeep cuts\u201d (mostly songs off her previous album, Visions) with the bulk of Art Angels, everything marinated in an enhancing dry rub of\u00a0MSG cut with PCP. A big red bow controlling a mane of blond hair, lurid turquoise T-shirt over cut-offs, she is possessed by gleeful energy. Then, between songs, Grimes becomes Boucher, a nervous young Canadian woman, embarrassed at the repeated pauses she has to take because the crowd won\u2019t stop cheering, even when she asks us nicely. \u201cStop it, it makes me stressed out, I\u2019m very shy!\u201d she blethers. Cue more screaming. The only thing to do is to start rapping in Russian \u2013 the vocal to Scream, originally in Mandarin, by Taiwanese rapper Aristophanes. Later in the set, for Venus Fly, the song\u2019s martial rhythm section is multiplied tenfold. The build is monstrous; the drop, apocalyptic. The\u00a0dancers have lasers shooting from their fingertips for a revamped version\u00a0of Be\u00a0a Body. For Go, a non-album cut that\u00a0Grimes did with Blood\u00a0Diamonds, they have daggers. Soon afterwards, Grimes apologises\u00a0for having swallowed her own hair. Before Oblivion, she reminds us to hydrate, and not crush our peers. (The girl behind me has already fainted.) She plays her encore straight after\u00a0the main set, because, thanks to her nerves, \u201cOnce I\u2019m gone\u2026\u201d It\u2019s easily the most explosive track off Art Angels, Kill V Maim, which may (or may not) be about The Godfather if he were a gender-bending vampire. It features the keynote chorus: \u201cHey, oh, don\u2019t behave.\u201d Hosting the pop rave of your dreams, Grimes and her crew are having a blast so palpable, so unrelenting, it actually feels like a\u00a0game-changer.

            "title": "One World: Together at Home review \u2013 locked-down stars lift the spirits",
            "content": "With Together at Home, Lady Gaga brought together music stars from around the world to give everyone something they so desperately need at this time of acute crisis: a chance to judge the interior design choices of the rich and famous. As you watch this compilation of live performances recorded in stars\u2019 homes while they, like everyone else, self-isolate due to coronavirus, it\u2019s a bit like going round a house with an estate agent: you\u2019re pretending to listen to what they\u2019re saying, but you\u2019re actually trying to check out their bookshelves and thinking, my God, those kitchen units are divine/awful. Lady Gaga\u2019s home performance space is full of chaotic energy, featuring gold dumbbells and a suitcase pasted with sheet music. On the plus side, Mick Jagger\u2019s taste in floral curtains is rather chic, and John Legend\u2019s house has the desert-modernism aesthetic down pat. In an act of elite-level passive aggression, Elton John has plonked a piano in the middle of his outdoor basketball court, presumably to stop his kids driving him mad during lockdown with endless attempts at three-pointers. All this ogling is not really in the spirit of the event, which is a deeply earnest appreciation from the stars for essential workers, their performances interspersed with coverage of the fight against the virus, and shows of support from Oprah Winfrey, Michelle Obama and others. It begins with six hours of online livestreamed performances along with calls to donate to the WHO\u2019s Solidarity Response Fund, before the star wattage intensifies for the TV broadcast and the tone changes. \u201cPut your wallets away,\u201d Gaga says. \u201cIt\u2019s our love letter to the world \u2013 the incredible artists we\u2019ve got lined up for you, they\u2019re all here to say thank-you, to celebrate you, to give back a little bit of kindness that you\u2019ve given to us.\u201d For the UK, there\u2019s a tweaked version of the package, featuring a higher proportion of Brits including Paul McCartney and Tom Jones, plus social media montages of stars including the athletes Mo Farah and Jessica Ennis-Hill.  There is of course a rather luvvie-ish tendency on show here, that the world will be soothed with the divine gift of song; the weariest health workers watching might have preferred a donation of funds for PPE rather than pop power couple Shawn Mendes and Camila Cabello thinking to themselves what a wonderful world it is, no matter how gorgeous and gorgeously harmonised they are. But these performances are often beautiful and display rare gifts. Stevie Wonder\u2019s medley of Bill Withers\u2019 Lean on Me with his own Love\u2019s in Need of Love Today is a robust double-helix of solidarity. The Rolling Stones\u2019 rendition of You Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want is superbly intimate, Jagger\u2019s big-hearted vocals juxtaposing perfectly with Keith Richards\u2019 Tom Waits-esque murmurs: stoicism and caution in a brotherly duet. Jennifer Lopez isn\u2019t generally thought of as a balladeer, but her performance of Barbra Streisand\u2019s People is Broadway-powerful, and its subject matter \u2013 humility in crisis \u2013 makes it perfectly chosen. Elton\u2019s performance of I\u2019m Still Standing is less good, delivered in the clipped \u201cclub style\u201d of Shooting Stars. Among the new generation, Billie Eilish is typically spellbinding. She picks out Sunny by Bobby Hebb, an infectiously joyful tune, but while the lyrics face forward into brightness and joy, the way Eilish performs it \u2013 using her sensual, high-frequency vibrato \u2013 acknowledges the pain that came before. Burna Boy\u2019s song African Giant \u2013 \u201cTell em Africa we done dying\u201d \u2013 deftly rebuts the narrative of desperate African strife that has dominated all-star benefit shows in the past, and Taylor Swift\u2019s moving performance of Soon You\u2019ll Get Better, originally written for her unwell mother, will no doubt have powerfully resonated with those whose family members are currently stricken. The line \u201cThis won\u2019t go back to normal, if it ever was\u201d, takes on a quiet political edge, too. The BBC\u2019s package of the material slots it into a shiny-floor studio format ably presented by Clara Amfo, Claudia Winkleman and Dermot O\u2019Leary, the latter dressed to audition for a porn parody of the Steve Jobs documentary. The music takes a more soundtracking role with plenty of heartwarming montages of British health workers, bin men and more. There\u2019s also a wonderful sequence where Skip Marley plays his grandfather Bob\u2019s I Wanna Love You as a surprise first dance song for an NHS nurse who had her wedding cancelled because of the crisis \u2013 Richard E Grant plays best man, with Nadiya Hussain as cake provider. Paul McCartney\u2019s Lady Madonna is jazzily interpreted almost to the point of incoherence, but he and Tom Jones give evocative personal tributes to the NHS, with Jones remembering his own isolation at the hands of tuberculosis as a child. Michael Bubl\u00e9 \u2013 whose young son was treated for cancer in 2016 \u2013 delivers a rightly sentimental take on God Only Knows for health workers, but it\u2019s Little Mix who are the best of the Beeb exclusives with a perfectly harmonised version of Touch. Their melancholic take on a track that\u2019s about being ragingly horny hints at a painful side of self-isolation that only a pop song could address in this family-friendly format.  There are striking moments across the six-hour preamble, too. Ellie Goulding\u2019s admission \u2013 \u201cI can get quite socially anxious, so you\u2019d think [lockdown] would be a breeze for me, but actually I\u2019m finding it really hard\u201d \u2013 is a moment of bracing candour amid the peace-and-love bromides, and the husk that develops around her voice as she pushes it into the red is one of pop\u2019s loveliest sounds. Kesha\u2019s ferocious-sounding cat sounds like it\u2019s keeping someone off camera well over two metres away; South African rapper Sho Madjozi flips her Good Over Here with lyrics castigating people breaking lockdown, and is one of the few moments of genuine fun. K-pop super-boyband SuperM are charming, indulging in lockdown pursuits like exercising, drawing, building a model ship and cooking some rubbish-looking bruschetta as they sing; the comment feed duly explodes into heart emojis. But it\u2019s Italian star Zucchero who steals the show, covering Everybody\u2019s Gotta Learn Sometimes on piano. The Korgis\u2019 song is about the loss of innocence at realising the sheer power of love, but in this context is charged with something even deeper: the pain of grief and the inevitability of death. Although it\u2019s celebrating the work of the WHO, no one comes out to denounce Donald Trump\u2019s defunding of the organisation; Pearl Jam\u2019s Eddie Vedder edited out the government-bashing lyrics in his otherwise extremely powerful rendition of River Cross. Perhaps there is reticence to be seen to be politicising the crisis, despite it being so profoundly political. A cynical reading is that these performances are merely good PR, which of course they are; a more pointed criticism might be that for all the talk of it bringing people together, music is actually quite impotent in the face of such a devastating disease, and that awareness hardly needed to be raised about it. The situation is so grave for some that art will seem facile, even indulgent. But Gaga et al\u2019s intentions are ultimately noble, the performers are sincere, and their song choices channel poignancy, acknowledge tenacity and invite self-reflection. They also, meanwhile, show that the chief interior lighting choice for celebrities is the soulful application of candles. "

            "title": "K-pop Party review: JJCC and Boyfriend offer a lesson in painstaking pop",
            "content": "Formed by Jackie Chan\u2019s management company, the South Korean boyband JJCC are all razor-sharp cheekbones and architectural hairstyles, dressed in the kind of fashionable get-ups you or I might struggle to put on by ourselves. They\u2019re on stage in front of an enthusiastic crowd of five or six hundred and, at the behest of two cheery MCs, they\u2019re passing around a meat pie. Some of the seven-piece receive the Australian icon with more enthusiasm than others \u2013 but they\u2019re all professionals about it. \u201cI\u2019ll eat it after the show,\u201d says Prince Mak, to the dismay of the crowd. \u201cOh \u2026 now?\u201d Now! It\u2019s part of a surreal cultural exchange \u2013 west meets east, east eats western meat \u2013 going on at the contemporary arts centre Carriageworks tonight. The City of Sydney is celebrating the lunar new year with K-pop Party, featuring the double act of JJCC and the six-piece Boyfriend live in concert and conversation, wrangled by SBS PopAsia. The setting is an odd choice: pop music and parlour games seem out of place at the same wine-and-cheese arts festival venue where I once saw a man play an electric guitar with a Brillo pad (the program said it was a statement about scientific ethics). But K-pop is an multibillion-dollar cultural phenomenon in east and south-east Asia, grossing by Billboard estimates as much as A$4.8bn in the first half of 2012 alone. And while neither group performing tonight rivals the giants of the genre \u2013 Big Bang, 2NE1 or Girls\u2019 Generation \u2013 Boyfriend in particular has a sizeable following. You can\u2019t argue with bankability. Tickets to K-pop Party started at $70, but $120 got you a \u201chigh touch\u201d: a fleeting one-on-one encounter with the \u201cidols\u201d which, going by the enthusiastic posts to Boyfriend\u2019s Australian fan club (\u201cBESTFRIEND\u201d) on Facebook, is a small price to pay. Some started queuing outside Carriageworks in the morning for a start time of 7pm. The music itself is more NSYNC or Backstreet Boys than One Direction; while it\u2019s new to me, it\u2019s not to most of the hundreds here. There\u2019s no overstating K-pop\u2019s popularity in Asia but ever since Psy\u2019s break-out hit, Gangnam Style, in 2012, it has spread to other parts of the world, too \u2013 and by no means just among young women. Tonight\u2019s crowd is the most diverse I\u2019ve seen at such a concert, across age, race and gender. By contrast, the tens of thousands at 1D\u2019s Sydney stadium show last year broadly fell into two categories: female fans of up to 25, and their parents. JJCC are the opening act and, as they bound on stage to perform Fire, it\u2019s clear that some of these devout fans know the words, if not what they mean: aside from a couple of songs with English-language choruses (\u201cthe roof is on fire!\u201d), the groups mostly sing and rap in Korean. Caught between the two worlds is Henry \u201cPrince\u201d Mak. He grew up in western Sydney and studied music at the University of New South Wales, before moving to China in 2012 to pursue a career in the entertainment industry. He scored a spot in Chan\u2019s upcoming boyband in a talent competition, and with it a strictly regimented schedule \u2013 each day begins with a 5.45am wake-up call, before six hours of dancing and \u201cindividual talent\u201d practice. \u201cNothing comes easy,\u201d he told Guardian Australia in 2014. \u201cI\u2019m half a planet away from my family, here all by myself. If I was going to slack off, I might as well have stayed in Australia.\u201d This is Prince Mak\u2019s first trip back to Sydney in four years and the first time he has seen his parents in that time. They\u2019re both here tonight, as is his 85-year-old grandmother in a wheelchair. \u201cSo please look after her all right, she\u2019s pretty old,\u201d he tells the crowd. Later he invites his mother to join JJCC for their song Be Good, which he performs standing at her side. \u201cLike I said before, it\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen my family \u2013 don\u2019t cry,\u201d he tells the crowd, when they make sympathetic noises. \u201cHe\u2019s so happy to be home,\u201d explains JJCC\u2019s Eddy. It might just be small talk \u2013 as a native English speaker, Prince Mak shoulders the burden of the banter between songs \u2013 but he brings up his parents so many times that you have to wonder if the K-pop machine is starting to take its toll. The high-energy, complicated dance moves, the rap breakdowns, the vocal harmonies \u2013 it looks like hard work. At the end of each song, each members\u2019 faces are slick as though coated with Vaseline \u2013 one passes around paper towels. Much is made of Simon Cowell\u2019s iron rule over his proteges, but One Direction were at least spared choreography. When JJCC launch into a cover of Justin Bieber\u2019s Boyfriend, in not only tuneful harmony but a second language, I\u2019m forced to wonder: is the west asking enough of its pop stars? During the Q&A, JJCC\u2019s SimBa is asked what he\u2019d be doing if he was not an \u201cidol\u201d \u2013 the term given to the artists trained, managed and otherwise moulded by South Korean talent agencies for K-pop superstardom. A taxi driver, he says. Another member is called upon for a word of wisdom for aspiring idols. \u201cJust do it!\u201d is his optimistic reply. The crowd has swelled to the best part of a thousand in time for the main act. Boyfriend are \u201cin the top Korean K-pop bands you should know\u201d (The 10 Best Review); according to Wikipedia, they are the first boy band to feature twins. Before the group\u2019s debut in 2011, the twins Jo Youngmin and Jo Kwangmin trained for two years with JYP Entertainment, one of the three biggest K-pop agencies. Tonight both seem distant and uninterested while performing, perhaps unmoved by the comparatively small crowd: Boyfriend has a huge following in South Korea and Japan, and spent the best part of last year on a world tour, which included their first gig in Argentina at a 9,200-person venue. Youngmin spends the entire hour with his earpiece smacking against his collarbone, and does not immediately return to the stage with the rest of the group for the encore. It contrasts with the front-facing, painstaking enthusiasm of JJCC, but after close to five years at the K-pop coalface \u2013 and many more besides in the industry \u2013 Boyfriend still put on an engaging show. Because how could they not? Two hours of song, dance and \u201cfan service\u201d from performers programmed to entertain \u2013 fans couldn\u2019t help but feel they\u2019d had their piece of the pie. "

            "title": "Lacking Seoul? Why South Korea's thriving capital is having an identity crisis",
            "content": "In November 2015, a much-publicised process of crowdsourcing ideas and putting them to a vote culminated in the city of Seoul unveiling its current English-language slogan: \u201cI.Seoul.U.\u201d It met with more ridicule from the local English-speaking community than most of the South Korean capital\u2019s international PR moves (including, but hardly limited to, photoshopped versions for the long-suffering village of Fucking, Austria). \u201cThe arrogance, the vitriol and the self-appointed expertise evident in this explosion of online bile is extraordinary,\u201d wrote Korea Times columnist Andrew Salmon as he surveyed the announcement\u2019s aftermath. He argued that \u201cthe obvious, natural focus for Seoul tourism promotion is China and Japan\u201d, and that \u201cthe stark simplicity of I.Seoul.U may well speak to tourists hailing from these high-potential target markets [who have], on the whole, a poor command of English\u201d. Furthermore, the unconventional, offbeat, and quirky strapline, as he described it, puts it alongside the Nike \u201cswoosh\u201d and legendary graphic designer Milton Glaser\u2019s \u201cI \u2764 NY\u201d \u2013 both \u201cclassic exercises in branding\u201d exerting abstract emotional appeal. Indeed, I.Seoul.U was seen as a step forward in Seoul\u2019s branding. Whatever its innate strengths or weaknesses, the slogan has brought more attention to a city that has long suffered image problems. For most of the 65 years since its emergence from the destruction of the Korean War, both Seoul and South Korea in general have struggled to define themselves on the cultural world stage, despite going on to become one of the most impressive economic success stories in human history. The most relevant comparison in success is to the country\u2019s neighbour and former coloniser Japan. In a period of about 30 years Japan \u201cmoved out of its negative image to become one of the most admired countries in the world\u201d, in the words of place-branding consultant Simon Anholt.  \u201cKorea\u2019s image is improving, because Korea is improving,\u201d he said more recently. \u201cIt\u2019s getting richer and more confident,\u201d yet its officials continue to self-defeatingly insist on \u201cconstantly publicising the fact they want a better image\u201d. Anholt believes \u201cimpatience, a lack of objectivity, boring strategies, faulty leadership, a naive faith in the power of propaganda, and a desire for quick fixes and short cuts\u201d, are among the most common obstacles to proper nation branding; and for all the strengths of the country itself, South Korea still occasionally falls victim to these vices. Just last month it scrapped its English-language national brand \u201cCreative Korea\u201d, developed last year at a cost of $3m, amid accusations of a lack of creativity and, given France\u2019s previous use of the brand \u201cCreative France\u201d, of plagiarism as well. Japan may have a higher profile than South Korea, but not every branding scheme has been a work of genius. Around the same time as I.Seoul.U, the Japanese capital rolled out its own awkward quasi-English slogan \u201c& Tokyo\u201d. Yet whereas the nation of Japan and the city of Tokyo maintain two related but essentially independent public images, South Korea can\u2019t be discussed apart from Seoul quite so easily. Half of the entire country\u2019s population lives in the 25 million-strong Seoul metropolitan area, and South Koreans from other regions have continued to regard Seoul as the only place affording real opportunity. To a great extent, Seoul is Korea and Seoul\u2019s image is Korea\u2019s. The country and the capital have developed in tandem, and the inextricability of those two processes lies at the heart of Korean architecture professor Jieheerah Yun\u2019s recent study Globalizing Seoul. Yun assesses the historically inward-looking city\u2019s efforts to turn outward, presenting itself no longer as an \u201cindustrial \u2018hard city\u2019 emphasising speed and efficiency\u201d, but as a \u201csoft city\u201d, one that values \u201cthe appreciation of invisible things, such as cultural and emotional wellbeing\u201d \u2013 prioritising aesthetics as well as economics. The idea, she writes, has been to move away from the \u201cdevelopment dictatorship\u201d that produced a monotonous, hastily constructed concrete-and-steel metropolis filled with lookalike office buildings and apartment towers (also plagued for a time with disasters, most tragically the 1995 collapse of the Sampoong department store) towards a more participatory process to remake Seoul as a \u201cversatile \u2018cultural\u2019 city filled with tangible and intangible resources\u201d. In the past 15 years many urbanist-celebrated projects have popped up based on these rather abstract notions. There is Cheonggyecheon, a life-filled stream running through downtown Seoul where an elevated freeway once stood; the Dongdaemun Design Plaza (DDP), an unearthly metallic museum and shop complex designed by the late Zaha Hadid placed in the centre of a busy market neighbourhood; and most recently Seoullo 7017, an overpass turned urban park that has been compared with Manhattan\u2019s High Line since opening in May.  Yet this publicity also provided a chance for the media to once again highlight the sources of Seoul\u2019s inferiority complex: \u201cBuilt up quickly during the country\u2019s astonishingly fast industrialisation,\u201d wrote the Washington Post\u2019s Anna Fifield, the city has \u201coften been derided with the saying, \u2018There\u2019s no soul in Seoul\u2019\u201d.  The official branding work meant to counteract that image goes back a decade when the International Council of Societies of Industrial Design selected Seoul as its \u201cWorld Design Capital\u201d for 2010. The local government soon launched the Design Seoul campaign as an effort to \u201celevate Seoul to the hub of the world design industry\u201d, thereby introducing the English term \u201cdesign\u201d into the mainstream Korean lexicon.  It has since turned into an all-encompassing catch phrase, according to Yun, or in the words of one member of activist artist collective FF Group: \u201cA master key that can be used for anything,\u201d including the justification of questionable or undemocratic policies. That ambiguous buzzword certainly did its part to push through the construction of the DDP, a successful quasi-public space as well as a costly infusion of foreign prestige that, not without controversy, replaced an old sports stadium and flea market grounds. The DDP\u2019s early promotional materials made explicit comparisons to Frank Gehry\u2019s Guggenheim Museum Bilbao and its supposed economic and cultural revival of the post-industrial Spanish city. The buildings do have much in common, especially a similarly tenuous connection to the cities that surround them.  Yun quotes architect and branding scholar Anna Klingmann, warning that these potentially \u201cshort-lived images of dazzling signature projects\u201d produce \u201ca culture of the copy, imitating one another in their offerings and aesthetics\u201d. It remains to be seen whether the DDP, which opened in 2014, will ultimately attain international recognition an icon of Seoul. In 2012, with the DDP still under construction, a very different cultural project had already turned into a global phenomenon, spreading an image of the city to every corner of the world: Gangnam Style. No official branding effort, however well-meaning or well-funded, could have hoped to reach as many people across the world as the singer-rapper Psy\u2019s mesmerisingly odd music video \u2013 which for years was the most viewed on Youtube. Psy\u2019s song and video satirises the boastful, free-spending, strenuously westernised and usually heavily indebted lifestyle associated with the capital in general, and Gangnam in particular \u2013 an area that developed far later than north of the river Han.  \u201cAs late as the 1970s, most of the Gangnam area was rice paddies or agricultural fields,\u201d writes Yun, \u201cbut it did not remain undeveloped for long.\u201d As the government built bridges and rail lines across the Han River, relocated important institutions and elite schools to the south, and offered tax incentives to developers, Gangnam became the popular place to live, with house prices rising and \u201cproducing numbers of nouveau riche who became rich through real estate speculations\u201d. Land prices north of the Han increased 2,500% from 1963 to 1979 \u2013 not a bad profit, except that those in Gangnam increased between 80,000-130,000% over the same period. When Gangnam Style exploded, the mighty Korean pop culture industry had been hard at work for almost 15 years. But the appeal of this so-called \u201cKorean wave\u201d of melodramatic TV and glossy music videos proved primarily aspirational, mostly washing over Korea\u2019s Asian neighbours and hardly lapping the shores of the west. Busy grooming squadrons of humourless boy and girl groups as indistinguishable as the country\u2019s high-rise apartment complexes, the corporate entities behind K-pop couldn\u2019t have predicted that the chunky, slightly over-the-hill Psy would be the one to break through to global superstardom.  By the same token, the earnest promoters of Seoul wouldn\u2019t have guessed that so much of the world would get its first impression of the city from, essentially, a joke. Before the 21st century, Seoul had no global image to speak of, and only when it suddenly got one did it become clear that nobody quite knew how best to capitalise on it. For decades, Seoul\u2019s own residents had likened their city \u201cto a concrete forest devoid of emotional fulfilment\u201d, Yun writes. \u201cHigh pollution levels, uncommunicative architectural designs, and the lack of traditional ambience in Seoul were highlighted as major problems.\u201d  Realising that before Seoul could be sold to the world, it first needed to be sold to Seoulites, officials launched poster campaigns emblazoned with friendly faces and voice bubbles saying, \u201cI like to design\u201d and \u201cSeoul is great!\u201d, all meant to assure residents that \u201cin contrast to previous development projects, contemporary urban projects are designed to satisfy individual needs and comforts rather than fulfilling abstract national goals\u201d, according to Yun. The FF Group, fired up with a characteristically Korean suspicion of political authority (most recently demonstrated in the ejection of the country\u2019s former president) and critical of such a PR push in a city still shot with poverty and neglect, drastically modified this simple messaging. They added stickers to the posters to make those smiling Seoulites say things like: \u201cChildren skip meals because [the city government focuses on] design,\u201d and \u201cOnly Gangnam is great!\u201d  One has never had to look hard to find a harsh critic of the city, and even its defenders have struggled to articulate what they love about it: I.Seoul.U\u2019s competition included the even emptier expressions \u201cSeoulmate,\u201d \u201cSeouling,\u201d and \u201cSurprising Seoul\u201d. If Koreans can\u2019t clearly perceive the identity of modern Seoul, the problem must be in large part due to the country\u2019s modernisation process itself, involving an obsessive focus on imitating the west.  In his recent book The New Koreans: the Business, History, and People of South Korea, former journalist and consultant Michael Breen quotes an official who, complaining about his country\u2019s \u201cborrowed\u201d mindset, compares life for a modern Korean to \u201cwearing shirts and pants that don\u2019t fit. Most majors we study were not created by us. Nor are the sports we play, the music we listen to, the movies we watch, or even the food we eat. Most specialists and experts study abroad. In their minds, the ideal destination is not here.\u201d Physical modernisation has created as many problems as cultural modernisation. Overseen by such uncompromising 20th-century nation builders as dictator Park Chung-hee (who ruled from 1963 to 1979) and Seoul mayor Kim Hyonok (whose Robert Moses-like penchant for building large concrete structures on razed old neighbourhoods earned him the nickname \u201cthe Bulldozer\u201d), Seoul swiftly converted from a relatively quiet Japanese colonial city into an industrial powerhouse. \u201cCriticism of this regime coincided with the decline of manufacturing businesses in Seoul as labour costs increased,\u201d writes Yun. \u201cManufacturing plants started to relocate elsewhere, mostly overseas, where the cost of labour was much cheaper. As soon as Seoul reached the zenith of its success as an industrial city, as such it was already on the way to its demise.\u201d  The scramble to outfit Seoul for its post-industrial age has seen the government commission many studies; one of the earliest of which, in 2002, found the city\u2019s \u201curban spaces in general\u201d \u2013 the crisscrossing expressways and grey forests of tower blocks \u2013 \u201cnot conducive to the cultivation of cultures\u201d. In order to create such spaces, it became more important to generate a \u201cdistinctive image of the place, attractive and unique in its own way\u201d, according to Yun. This has put the city, and indeed the country, in \u201cthe paradoxical position of having to prove their modernity while preserving Korean traditions\u201d nearly lost in the manic drive to \u201ccatch up\u201d with the developed world \u2013 and in many cases rediscovering, reintroducing, and even reinventing them. (Some vestiges of old Seoul, such as its traditional hanok courtyard houses, now survive primarily as either tourist attractions or investments.) This aligns neatly with the conception of Seoul held by Park Won-soon, the city\u2019s mayor since 2011 and an enemy of big projects who, even after taking office, criticised the likes of the DDP as showy and wasteful. He champions free lunches and vegetable gardens in schools, the pedestrianisation of public spaces, and not the demolition, but the reuse of existing structures of all ages \u2013 Seoullo 7017\u2019s origin as a 47-year-old eyesore is a showcase example. Park has made no secret of his higher political ambitions. He may one day leverage his accomplishments in a presidential bid, as did former president Lee Myung-bak, who oversaw the building of the Cheonggyecheon as mayor of Seoul. Modern Seoul has thus tapped into the fashion for small-scale urban development now seen everywhere from Mexico City to Montreal, from Brooklyn to Berlin. A cornucopia of 21st-century city-dweller\u2019s delights \u2013 bakeries, boutiques, independent bookstores, record shops, specialty coffee roasters, urban garden spaces \u2013 now appear alongside the traditional humble noodle shops and sprawling markets. And whether they hail from elsewhere in Asia or the west, most of the foreign friends I\u2019ve taken through it express aloud their desire to put down stakes in Seoul, despite acknowledging its lack of conventional beauty. Seoul has come impressively far \u2013 even Seoulites have come to accept their city\u2019s status as a global brand. Magazine B, a Korean publication that scrutinises brands such as Penguin, Netflix, and Muji, recently put out a whole issue devoted to the capital.  If those in charge should learn anything from its checkered branding history, it\u2019s that the way forward lies not in imposing an identity based on existing models \u2013 the \u201csoft city\u201d, \u201cdesign capital\u201d or \u201cglobal city\u201d \u2013 but in first establishing the conditions for the city to find its own, neighbourhood by neighbourhood and even citizen by citizen. Or perhaps, rather than searching for one, 21st-century Seoul is deep in the process of constructing its identity anew. If Seoul must continue using English-language branding, perhaps it could translate the old Korean-language slogan: \u201cSeoul We Create Together, Seoul We Enjoy Together.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook to join the discussion, and explore our archive here "
