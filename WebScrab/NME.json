The protest song was officially released by the band via Virgin in May 1977. Despite being banned by the BBC, it reached number one on the NME chart and number two on the UK\u2019s singles chart (the track was listed as a blank on the latter to avoid causing offence). Prior to that, however, the band had been controversially dropped by their previous label A&M, prompting the destruction of 25,000 unreleased copies of \u2018God Save The Queen\u2019. Only a handful of copies of the original A&M release remain, with one selling for \u00a313,000 back in 2019. Ahead of the Queen\u2019s Platinum Jubilee, which will be celebrated in the UK from June 2-5 to mark Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s 70 years on the throne, the Sex Pistols will reissue both the Virgin and A&M versions of \u2018God Save The Queen\u2019 on May 27 via UMC. Sex Pistols \u2013 \u2018God Save The Queen\u2019 reissue (Picture: Press) 1,977 7\u2033 copies of the A&M version of the single, which features the B-side \u2018No Feeling\u2019, will be made available, while 4000 7\u2033 copies of the Virgin-released \u2018God Save The Queen\u2019 (featuring the B-side \u2018Did You No Wrong\u2019) will go on sale. Both versions of the single will feature their original artwork, with the A&M edition featuring its generic company sleeve and being pressed on silver/platinum vinyl. The Virgin single will feature the Jamie Reid-designed Sex Pistols artwork. Pre-order is available now from here.  Sex Pistols frontman John Lydon recently distanced himself from the band\u2019s compilation \u2018The Original Recordings\u2019, which is set for release later this month. \u201cHe and his team were not involved in producing this compilation and consider it substandard compared to previous Universal releases since 2012,\u201d a statement on the singer\u2019s Facebook page read.

            "content": "American director Lance Bangs is set to helm a new docuseries entitled\u00a0I Don\u2019t Belong Here, which will focus on the rise of alternative rock in the 1990s. The series, announced yesterday (May 2), will be made by the production company Anonymous Content, although it\u2019s unclear which network it will appear on. It marks Bangs\u2019 return to television after several years, having worked on episodes of Portlandia\u00a0and\u00a0The Meltdown With Jonah And Kumail\u00a0in the mid-2010s. The series\u2019 title is taken from the chorus of Radiohead\u2018s 1993 hit \u2018Creep\u2019, which has gone on to be regarded as one of the most notable alt-rock songs of the decade. A synopsis for the series, provided to Deadline, describes the sub-genre\u2019s commercial rise in the \u201990s as \u201can absurd and surreal moment\u201d in music history. \u201cThese are the stories \u2013 told by the musicians, scouts, producers and label heads \u2013 who did their best to make sense of a time that made no sense, when dope-fiending punk rock trolls swindled seven-figure advances and an anarchist Japanese noise collective wound up as labelmates with Fleetwood Mac,\u201d it continued.  Bangs was a notable contributor to \u201990s alt-rock via his prolific work as a music video director. Amongst those within the genre he worked with at the time are R.E.M., Pavement, Sonic Youth and Green Day. Bangs is also married to Corin Tucker, a member of \u201990s alt-rock band Sleater-Kinney. Bangs shared the\u00a0Deadline announcement in a screenshot posted to his Instagram page. In the caption, he also called for additional contributors to assist in making the series as comprehensive as possible. \u201cI\u2019m sure there are more stories from this era to learn from,\u201d he wrote, \u201cso reach out if you have them.\u201d Outside of his music-related work, Bangs was seen on cinema screens earlier this year as a cameraman for\u00a0Jackass Forever. Bangs has worked closely with the stunt and prank collective since their MTV series in 2000, and has appeared in all of their movies thus far. "

Davidson appeared at the festival last Friday (April 29) to premiere his new show, Pete Davidson And Best Friends, which was filmed for release on Netflix later in the year. To a sold-out crowd at Los Angeles\u2019 Fonda Theatre, he opened the set by nudging at the claims that West tried to spread rumours about Davidson \u2013 who is currently dating West\u2019s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian \u2013 having AIDS. \u201cI had an AIDS scare this year,\u201d he quipped (per Variety), telling his audience that he got himself tested for the condition since West is a \u201cgenius\u201d. He assured fans that he does not, in fact, have AIDS \u2013 he just looks like he does. Davidson reportedly went on to talk about feeling stuck when it came to responding to West\u2019s harassment, with none of the people in his inner circle able to give him advice for the situation. Another joke in the set \u2013 for which Kardashian was in attendance \u2013 saw Davidson warn Jon Stewart about a violent curse he may be entangled in; the comedian recalled going to a basketball game with him and Chris Rock last December, teasing that \u201cChris got slapped [and] I got decapitated\u201d. The line referenced West\u2019s video for his recent collaboration with The Game, \u2018Eazy\u2019, in which the rapper kidnaps and kills a claymated version of Davidson.  A second video for \u2018Eazy\u2019, shared weeks after the first, also saw Davidson brutalised. In the clip, an animated version of the skinned money from the single\u2019s cover art pins down a blurred-out avatar of Davidson, walloping him with a string of punches over West\u2019s lyric: \u201cGod saved me from that crash / Just so I can beat Pete Davidson\u2019s ass.\u201d Though he initially kept quiet on the matter, Davidson responded to West\u2019s attacks a few days after the second \u2018Eazy\u2019 video laded, writing to the rapper in a text: \u201cI\u2019ve decided I\u2019m not gonna let you treat us like this anymore and I\u2019m done being quiet.\u201d When West responded and asked Davidson where he was, the comedian sent back a selfie and wrote that he was \u201cin bed with your wife\u201d. West then said he was \u201chappy to see [Davidson] out of the hospital and rehab\u201d, to which Davidson replied: \u201cSame here. It\u2019s wonders what those places do when you go get help. You should try it.\u201d At the end of Davidson\u2019s sets at Netflix Is A Joke: The Festival, Machine Gun Kelly \u2013 a close friend, former housemate and longtime collaborator of the comedian \u2013 came onstage to perform a surprise three-song set.

            "content": "Morgan Wallen will perform at the 2022 Billboard Music Awards this month, a little over a year after footage of the country singer saying the N-word emerged. Set to take place on May 15 at the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas, it will mark the first performance at a major awards ceremony for the artist since last year\u2019s controversy saw him banned from that year\u2019s Country Music Awards, American Music Awards and, indeed, the Billboard Music Awards. As Billboard points out, the decision was made by media conglomerate MRC, who own Billboard along with the Hollywood Reporter. In a statement to\u00a0Billboard, a representative for MRC explained that the decision to invite Wallen to perform was made after extensive discussion by a diverse group of MRC staffers. \u201cWe oppose discrimination, harassment, or racism of any kind. We believe in treating everyone with dignity and respect,\u201d MRC told the publication. \u201cAfter a thorough review and robust discussions internally and with the artist\u2019s team, in which we found a demonstrated and ongoing commitment to meaningful work and outreach, we extended an invitation to participate in this year\u2019s show.\u201d Video emerged of Wallen saying the racial slur back in February of 2021, just a month after the release of his second album, \u2018Dangerous\u2019. The musician was quickly dropped from radio stations and playlists, and suspended from his label Big Loud, but despite the controversy, Wallen saw a surge in album sales. \u201cI used an unacceptable and inappropriate racial slur that I wish I could take back,\u201d Wallen commented in a statement shortly after the footage was released. \u201cThere are no excuses to use this type of language, ever. I want to sincerely apologise for using the word. I promise to do better.\u201d In May 2021, he returned to the stage for the first time since the controversy, performing at Kid Rock\u2018s Big Honky Tonky & Steakhouse bar in Nashville. His music returned to country radio\u00a0the following month. In July 2021, Wallen appeared on Good Morning America to discuss the controversy. During the interview, he committed to making amends by donating $500,000 to Black-led organisations. In September, it was reported that Wallen had allegedly only donated a third of that money, but Billboard now reports that Wallen had made good on the pledge.  Earlier this year, Wallen kicked off a North American tour in support of \u2018Dangerous\u2019, selling out dozens of dates on the run. Last month, Wallen won Album of the Year at the Academy of Country Music Awards. The singer did not directly address the controversy during his acceptance speech, but did thank those who had \u201cshown [him] grace along the way\u201d. Other performers set to take the stage at this year\u2019s Billboard Music Awards include Mary J. Blige, Megan Thee Stallion, Burna Boy, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Silk Sonic and Florence + the Machine.

Davidson appeared at the festival last Friday (April 29) to premiere his new show, Pete Davidson And Best Friends, which was filmed for release on Netflix later in the year. To a sold-out crowd at Los Angeles\u2019 Fonda Theatre, he opened the set by nudging at the claims that West tried to spread rumours about Davidson \u2013 who is currently dating West\u2019s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian \u2013 having AIDS. \u201cI had an AIDS scare this year,\u201d he quipped (per Variety), telling his audience that he got himself tested for the condition since West is a \u201cgenius\u201d. He assured fans that he does not, in fact, have AIDS \u2013 he just looks like he does. Davidson reportedly went on to talk about feeling stuck when it came to responding to West\u2019s harassment, with none of the people in his inner circle able to give him advice for the situation. Another joke in the set \u2013 for which Kardashian was in attendance \u2013 saw Davidson warn Jon Stewart about a violent curse he may be entangled in; the comedian recalled going to a basketball game with him and Chris Rock last December, teasing that \u201cChris got slapped [and] I got decapitated\u201d. The line referenced West\u2019s video for his recent collaboration with The Game, \u2018Eazy\u2019, in which the rapper kidnaps and kills a claymated version of Davidson.  A second video for \u2018Eazy\u2019, shared weeks after the first, also saw Davidson brutalised. In the clip, an animated version of the skinned money from the single\u2019s cover art pins down a blurred-out avatar of Davidson, walloping him with a string of punches over West\u2019s lyric: \u201cGod saved me from that crash / Just so I can beat Pete Davidson\u2019s ass.\u201d Though he initially kept quiet on the matter, Davidson responded to West\u2019s attacks a few days after the second \u2018Eazy\u2019 video laded, writing to the rapper in a text: \u201cI\u2019ve decided I\u2019m not gonna let you treat us like this anymore and I\u2019m done being quiet.\u201d When West responded and asked Davidson where he was, the comedian sent back a selfie and wrote that he was \u201cin bed with your wife\u201d. West then said he was \u201chappy to see [Davidson] out of the hospital and rehab\u201d, to which Davidson replied: \u201cSame here. It\u2019s wonders what those places do when you go get help. You should try it.\u201d At the end of Davidson\u2019s sets at Netflix Is A Joke: The Festival, Machine Gun Kelly \u2013 a close friend, former housemate and longtime collaborator of the comedian \u2013 came onstage to perform a surprise three-song set. The pair duetted on the \u2018Mainsteam Sellout\u2019 cut \u2018ay!\u2019, while MGK (real name Colson Baker) performed \u2018Candy\u2019 and \u2018make up sex\u2019 by himself. Take a look at Davidson introducing Baker\u2019s mini-set below:  Later this month, Davidson will star in Baker\u2019s directorial debut, Good Mourning, as an aggressive valet driver. The film will be out on May 20 \u2013 see the first trailer here. Later in the year \u2013 on August 5, to be exact \u2013 Davidson will star alongside Amandla Stenberg and Maria Bakalova in the comedy-horror film Bodies Bodies Bodies. Yard Act, Billy Nomates and Billy Bragg are among the leading names on the line-up of Glastonbury\u2018s Left Field for 2022. The stage is celebrating \u201c20 Years of Pop and Politics\u201d at this year\u2019s Worthy Farm festival, which runs from June 22-26.

Speaking about this year\u2019s Left Field line-up, stage co-curator Bragg said in a statement: \u201cSo much has happened in the three years since we last gathered under the Left Field big top. We\u2019ve pulled together an amazing roster of activists and artists determined to make sense of it all.

Music doesn\u2019t have agency to change the world but it can change how you feel. It\u2019s about empathy. We can\u2019t just dismiss it as entertainment. When we come out the other side of this, I think we\u2019ll appreciate these things a lot more.\u201d  Elsewhere at Glastonbury 2022, Arcadia will welcome DJ sets from the likes of Calvin Harris, Four Tet and Nia Archives, while Fatboy Slim, Romy and Mura Masa will perform in the Silver Hayes area. Sugababes and The Damned, meanwhile, are on the line-up for the Field Of Avalon. "

            "content": "DaBaby has been charged with felony battery for an alleged attack on the owner of a rental property he was using to shoot a music video. Gary Pagar claims\u00a0he was physically assaulted when he tried to stop the rapper\u2019s entourage from shooting the video on his Los Angeles property in December last year. According to TMZ, the incident occurred when DaBaby (real name Jonathan Kirk)\u00a0and his team were renting out a mansion managed by Pagar, who says he was told Kirk and his friends would only be using the property for vacation purposes. Pagar has claimed that the rapper\u2019s management team agreed to a 12-guest limit as outlined in the property\u2019s rental agreement, but at one point during their week-long stay, Pagar said he noticed more than a dozen people were inside the house. On December 2, Pagar said he stopped by the property and found in the region of 40 people on site, including a film crew who appeared to be shooting a music video for \u2018Play U Lay\u2019, a track by DaBaby\u2019s artist Stunna4Vegas.  Pagar then claims that after he approached Kirk to try and shut down the shoot, someone in the rapper\u2019s crew attacked the property owner. Although\u00a0Kirk allegedly ordered the crew member to stop, Pagar alleges that Kirk then punched him in the face, knocking out a tooth. Pagar filed a lawsuit against Kirk in February, which claims that he suffered serious injuries from the attack. Another member of the rapper\u2019s team, Thankgod Awute, has also been charged with felony robbery. DaBaby took to Twitter to respond to Pagar\u2019s claims, writing: \u201cY\u2019all keep beliving [sic] these type of people & helping em assassinate my character y\u2019all might as well get a rope & help him hang my black ass on a tree.\u201d Y\u2019all keep beliving these type of people & helping em assassinate my character y\u2019all might as well get a rope & help him hang my black ass on a tree. \u270a\ud83c\udffb pic.twitter.com/miO6daOyQZ \u2014 DaBaby (@DaBabyDaBaby) April 30, 2022  This is the latest in a long line of legal woes the rapper has been involved in over the last year. Last week, Rolling Stone obtained security footage of a 2018 incident where Kirk shot and killed a man named Jaylin Craig at a Charlotte-area Walmart, which the rapper has consistently claimed was in self-defence. The newly published security footage shows the lead-up to the shooting and its aftermath and appears to potentially contradict the rapper\u2019s version of events. He was then involved in another violent altercation last month, this time between himself and Charlotte rapper Wisdom, a recent signee to Kirk\u2019s Billion Dollar Baby Entertainment roster. That same month, a shooting took place at DaBaby\u2019s home in North Carolina, leaving one person injured.\u00a0While the shooter and the victim have not been named, a spokesperson from the Troutman Police Department said it was an \u201cisolated incident\u201d and that there was no further threat to the community. In February, the brother of singer/rapper DaniLeigh sued\u00a0DaBaby over an alleged unprovoked physical attack on him at a bowling alley in Los Angeles. "

After finding viral success for the track \u2018Racist, Sexist Boy\u2019, the band have appeared on a slew of late night US TV performances, beginning with a performance of their breakout track on\u00a0Jimmy Kimmel Live\u00a0last summer. Two months ago, they played \u2018Growing Up\u2019 on The Late Late Show With James Corden. \u2018Oh!\u2019 was first released as a single last year following the band\u2019s signing to Epitaph, and also appears on their debut album.  In a four star review of the record,\u00a0NME\u00a0said that \u201cTracks on here like \u2018Fine\u2019 and the aforementioned \u2018Racist, Sexist Boy\u2019 are vital, powerful bursts of punk fury. Yet when they let their pop music imaginations run free it\u2019s equally impressive, with tracks like \u2018Growing Up\u2019, \u2018Talking To Myself\u2019 and \u2018Magic\u2019 showcasing a gift for catchy, singalong choruses. Speaking to\u00a0NME last month about the making of the album, 15-year-old drummer Lucia de la Garza said: \u201cWe\u2019ve learned that music can do anything, and it can get you through anything. It\u2019s really fun to see how we\u2019re growing as musicians.  \u201cEven from the [self-titled] EP which we wrote only about a year before, you can see how we\u2019ve grown as songwriters, and see how we were trying to figure out what our sound is. We hope there are many more to come and that they keep showing how we\u2019re progressing.\u201d Meanwhile, The Linda Lindas have also been revealed as one of many bands involved in a covers album of Sleater-Kinney\u2018s 1997 album \u2018Dig Me Me Out\u2019, to celebrate its 25th birthday.

The singer-songwriter \u2013 aka Joshua Tillman \u2013 appeared as the musical guest on the latest episode of The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in support of his fifth album \u2018Chlo\u00eb And The Next 20th Century\u2019, which came out last month.

Tillman and co. performed in front of a draped red curtain and purple lights, treating viewers to an intimate version of the romantic ballad. Tune in here:  In\u00a0a five-star review of Father John Misty\u2019s new album, NME wrote: \u201cBesides its flirtations with big band-style instrumentals, \u2018Chlo\u00eb And The Next 20th Century\u2019 serves as a gorgeously crafted highlight reel of the singer\u2019s many previous styles and guises, rather than a complete reinvention. \u201cMuch of it is delivered with a wink, and is as dramatically brooding as his past work; every track is vivid yet still quietly dark as it conjures various kinds of lamentation.\u201d Father John Misty will showcase the record on a run of UK and European headline concerts in 2023, which includes a stop-off at the O2 Academy Brixton in London. You can find any remaining tickets here.  Meanwhile, it\u2019s been revealed that Joshua Tillman assisted Arcade Fire during the writing stages of the Canadian band\u2019s upcoming sixth album, \u2018WE\u2019. "

The K-pop icon became the highest-charting Korean pop act on the Billboard Hot 100 with the track peaking at Number Two. Since then, only BTS have gone on to best his record, hitting Number One six times since 2020. Speaking at a press conference for his new album \u2018PSY 9th\u2019 \u2013 which includes the single \u2018That That\u2019, featuring and produced by BTS\u2019 Suga \u2013 Psy reflected on the success of \u2018Gangnam Style\u2019 almost a decade ago. \u201cIt was so exhausting at the time of its success [because] the song got popular so it wasn\u2019t a \u2018healthy hit\u2019,\u201d he said, per fan translations. \u201cThere were even people who thought my name was \u2018Gangnam Style\u2019,\u201d he explained of the track\u2019s meme status in the West. \u201cSome people overseas who would say \u2018Hi, Gangnam Style\u2019.\u201d  Discussing the success that other Korean artists have experienced in the 10 years since \u2018Gangnam Style\u2019 was released, Psy said acts like BTS and BLACKPINK have achieved the \u201copposite\u201d of his viral fame because they have gained \u201cpermanence and persistence\u201d. \u201cThere are cases where the song increases in popularity and cases when the [artist] increases in popularity, and longevity is that much longer in the latter,\u201d he said. He also noted that even BTS and BLACKPINK still face barriers in the West, particularly in terms of radio play. \u201cThe wall of American radio is very high because the songs are in a foreign language,\u201d he explained. \u201cOur biggest weapon is YouTube.\u201d Singling out BTS, the star described the band as having \u201cachieved unfulfilled dreams\u201d \u2013 such as scoring a Number One hit in the US. \u201cIf they continue like this, though they\u2019re not doing music for the sake of raising national prestige, I think they\u2019re giving [Korea] a lot of proud moments,\u201d Psy added. \u201cI feel very proud that I had a role in being that trigger. BTS have thanked me for that part several times, so I\u2019m proud of it.\u201d In a recent interview discussing his involvement with Psy\u2019s new single \u2018That That\u2019, BTS\u2019 Suga revealed he wasn\u2019t initially aware how much he would be involved with the release. \u201cI seriously didn\u2019t expect to be dancing with Psy,\u201d he said. \u201cAh\u2026 I thought I was only writing the song.\u201d  Psy, meanwhile, explained: \u201cAt the beginning, we met because he wanted to produce my music. Then he ended up featuring on the track. Then he ended up learning the intense choreo[graphy]. Then he ended up starring in the music video. Step by step, he got involved more and more deeply.\u201d In other BTS news, the group will return on June 10 with a new album.

Concert Crush: The Travis Scott Festival Tragedy is an independent film helmed by documentarian Charlie Minn. In a recent interview with the Associated Press, the director said his aim was not to create a \u201chit piece toward Travis Scott\u201d when making the film. \u201cMy job is to make the most truthful, honest, sincere documentary from the victims\u2019 point of view,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need to know about these stories to prevent it from happening again.\u201d Live Nation, however, has not approved the film\u2019s release. The company is currently facing multiple lawsuits over its role in promoting Astroworld, while it has also been subject to a bipartisan investigation launched by US\u2019 House Oversight and Reform Committee. In a letter addressed to Texas state District Judge Kristen Hawkins \u2013 who, Billboard notes, is handling all pre-trial matters in the Astroworld lawsuits \u2013 Neal Manne and Kevin Yankowsky, two of the attorneys working on behalf of Live Nation, shared concerns that Concert Crush could have an impact on the outcome of the ongoing lawsuits. \u201cThe involvement of plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers in the film, and the publicity the filmmakers and producers are trying to generate for it raise significant issues about efforts to taint the jury pool,\u201d Manne and Yankowsky wrote. The pair have not, however, taken any legal action against Minn, nor have they made any formal effort to block to block the release of Concert Crush. Beginning this Friday (May 6), the film will screen in cinemas across 11 cities in Texas \u2013 including Houston, where the tragedy took place. A full list of the cities screening Concert Crush is available to view on the film\u2019s website. The film will include interviews with people who survived the crowd surge at Astroworld, as well as footage from the night that shows attendees repeatedly screaming for help. In a statement to the Associated Press, Frank Alvarez \u2013 who was in attendance at Astroworld, but does not appear in Concert Crush \u2013 supported the film\u2019s release. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain to friends and family what we saw and what we actually went through,\u201d he said, \u201cand I think [Concert Crush] will give a lot of people the opportunity, if you weren\u2019t there, to understand.\u201d Last month, Scott released his first song since Astroworld \u2013 a collaboration between himself, Future and 808 Mafia producer Southside titled \u2018Hold That Heat\u2019. The rapper has been making a slow comeback since the tragedy took place \u2013 he reportedly performed a short set at a private pre-Oscars party, and a brief DJ set at a Coachella afterparty. Last month, he announced the launch of his multi-million dollar Project HEAL initiative, and said he would \u201calways honor the victims of the Astroworld tragedy\u201d. The rapper was, however, accused of violating a gag order by announcing the initiative. Scott is currently facing hundreds of combined lawsuits over the events that unfolded at Astroworld. "

Notably, Ilese had co-written TXT\u2019s viral 2021 track \u2018Anti-Romantic\u2019 from \u2018The Chaos Chapter: Freeze\u2019.  In the same month,\u00a0Hueningkai released a cover\u00a0of Canadian singer\u00a0Avril Lavigne\u2019s early-2000s hit \u2018Sk8er Boi\u2019, shortly after Lavigne responded to a tweet by the idol, where he referenced the track. Lavigne has since shared his rendition of her song on Twitter,\u00a0where she praised it as \u201camazing\u201d. Hueningkai\u2019s version of \u2018Sk8er Boi\u2019 is the latest cover song he has released on the official TXT YouTube channel. Florence + The Machine have shared details for a five-date Australian and New Zealand tour, taking their upcoming \u2018Dance Fever\u2019 album Down Under in the first quarter of 2023. The run will start in Perth on Saturday March 4, when\u00a0Florence Welch and co. take to the stage at the RAC Arena. They\u2019ll head to Melbourne next, playing Rod Laver Arena on Wednesday March 8, before jetting up to Sydney for a gig at Qudos Bank Arena the following Monday (March 13). The last Australian show will go down at the Brisbane Entertainment Centre that Friday (March 17), with a sole Aotearoan gig pencilled in for Tuesday March 21 at Auckland\u2019s Spark Arena. Joining the group for all five dates will be indie-pop star King Princess, who is currently hard at work on the follow-up to her 2019 debut, \u2018Cheap Queen\u2019. That record, tentatively titled \u2018Hold On Baby\u2019, is due for release later this year, with the recent singles \u2018Little Brother\u2019 and \u2018For My Friends\u2019 expected to appear on it.

Announced back in March \u2013 and described by Welch as sounding like their 2009 debut \u2018Lungs\u2019 with \u201cmore self-knowledge\u201d \u2013 the band have shared four singles from it thus far: \u2018King\u2019, \u2018Heaven Is Here\u2019, \u2018My Love\u2019 and \u2018Free\u2019. It\u2019ll be their fifth full-length album, following 2018\u2019s \u2018High As Hope\u2019. Last month, Welch opened up about the creation of \u2018Dance Fever\u2019, saying: \u201cI had this drive underneath me and I was like if these songs want to get out, I have to get them out fast, because I do have other desires. The thing I\u2019ve always been sure of is my work, but I do start to feel this shifting of priorities, this sense of like\u2026maybe I want something different.\u201d  The band debuted tracks from the album live in Newcastle last month, performing a series of new cuts including the unreleased \u2018Girls Against God\u2019. They\u2019ll embark on an arena tour of the UK and Europe later this year, taking in 11 shows between Paris and Dublin this November. It\u2019ll follow an expansive tour throughout North America, where the band will play shows with Arlo Parks, Sam Fender, King Princess, Yves Tumor, Japanese Breakfast and Wet Leg on select dates.

Now, speaking to Rolling Stone, Tree has since elaborated on the similarities between the videos. \u201cThe exact same frame, the exact same ambulance, the exact same thing. It just seemed a little bit odd that even the framing is exactly the same,\u201d the he told the publication. \u201cIt\u2019s all about taking something that exists and flipping it and doing something new, but you got to be smart about it,\u201d Tree added. The songwriter continued that he had decided not to pursue legal action against Breslauer or LAROI, and that while he wasn\u2019t \u201ctrying to ruin the guy\u2019s career\u201d, he did want to raise awareness around the issue of smaller artists having their work used as inspiration for more prominent acts.  Neither Breslauer nor The Kid LAROI have commented on the perceived similarities. NME has reached out to a representative for LAROI. "

Through multiple books, including Go Ahead in the Rain: Notes on A Tribe Called Quests\u00a0and A Little Devil in America: Notes in Praise of Black Performance, the National Book Award finalist and MacArthur \u201cGenius Grant\u201d recipient has built a career focused on extending the \u201cunderstanding of the multitudinous and global nature of Black performance.\u201d With the intention of highlighting Black musicianship, celebrating the return of in-person communal experiences, and \u201cexpanding my imagining of what a live music concert can be\u201d, the essayist and critic organised America\u2019s oldest performing arts centre\u2019s first foray into live music since the start of the COVID pandemic. The intimate and creative shows, which kicked off on February 25 and run until June 11, have featured Abdurraqib\u2019s hand-picked selection of artists, including Moses Sumney, Bartees Strange, Devont\u00e9 Hynes, and L\u2019Rain, with performances from Mavis Staples,\u00a0and\u00a0the premiere of Omar Offendum\u2019s hip-hop musical, Little Syria taking place later this month, and a show featuring Nikki Giovanni set for June. Hanif Abdurraqib introduces BAM performances CREDIT: Edwina Hay \u201cIt\u2019s interesting to be in a position where you can do anything, because my initial response was, \u2018Well I don\u2019t wanna do anything\u2019,\u201d Abdurraqib told NME. When BAM reached out and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll give you Howard Gilman Opera House and this budget and the rest is up to you,\u201d he found the proposition exciting \u2013 but also daunting \u2013 because, \u201cThat kind of freedom comes with an expectation that you will not mess it up.\u201d However, once he \u201ctook that freedom and offered it to artists\u201d, he wanted to see perform, asking them: \u201cWhat would you do if you had time and a space to build something creative and challenge yourself without the constraints of a typical touring schedule or a touring set list?\u201d he was able to shake himself \u201cfree of anxieties\u201d. For Abdurraqib, putting on the series of shows was his \u201cwildest dream\u201d, and he wanted to \u201clive up to the enormity of that dreaming\u201d once BAM gave him the opportunity to make it a reality. BAM audience during intermission CREDIT: Edwina Hay \u201cI remember the first show, I was so nervous,\u201d he recalled of the February 25 performance, which featured Mdou Moctar and Bartees Strange. \u201cIt had sold out, but part of me was still like, are people going to come to this? I also hadn\u2019t been to a show of that scale in a long time and had been slowly easing myself back into live music.\u201d During the performance, he decided to stand side stage for Strange\u2019s \u201cwonderful\u201d set, before heading to the box seats for the rest of the show. \u201cI kind of looked down on the entire crowd and there was a point where they started playing the album in acoustic, and then moved to electric and he asked people to stand up,\u201d he said, noting how that moment in the show stood out to him. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a demand or a command but people were so eager to move, to stand and dance in the aisles.\u201d The author also told us that each evening had been a \u201csingular\u201d experience, adding that for Moses Sumney\u2019s two-hour \u2018Blackalachia in Brooklyn\u2019 performance on March 30, which saw him playing music amid projections of his live concert film, the audience was \u201csitting in awe and in reverence of what was happening.\u201d Moses Sumney performs at BAM CREDIT: Ellen Maurer On April 4, Devont\u00e9 Hynes [AKA Blood Orange] did something he\u2019d \u201cnever done before\u201d, according to Abdurraqib. Through a night of solo and collaborative performances from Third Coast Percussion, pianist Adam Tendler, and the String Orchestra of Brooklyn, Hynes relied completely on instrumentals, without adding any lyrics or even spoken words to his songs. Between each selection, the audience would erupt into clapping. Hynes would clap towards the attendees thanking them as well. \u201cThese audience reactions have been a real delight for me to be a witness to,\u201d Abdurraqib told us. \u201cMy hope was always that these shows would act as an exchange between artists and audience.\u201d Devont\u00e9 Hynes aka Blood Orange performs at BAM CREDIT: Edwina Hay He continued: \u201cI believe live music, or any kind of live performance to be an active exchange. Not just a place where people take from the performer or the performer takes from the audience. We all have a duty within that exchange, even if the exchange is being transported and being in awe of that transportation.\u201d For singer-songwriter, L\u2019Rain, who took the stage before Sumney\u2019s performance, playing at BAM with artists she admires was \u201csomething so incredible I never even thought to include a show like this on my dream list.\u201d She added: \u201cIt would have seemed too out of reach.\u201d L\u2019Rain CREDIT: Ellen Maurer Last year, the Brooklyn-raised artist (born Tara Cheek) released her second album \u2018Fatigue\u2019 where she experimented with ambient noise and leaned into lush orchestration among her hushed vocals. \u201cI never would have thought that this strange music, some of which I made in my literal bed, could make sense on a stage this epic and historied,\u201d the songwriter and multi-instrumentalist told NME. For Cheeks, the \u201cshow, in particular, felt like such a beautiful full-circle moment,\u201d for her music and a city coming back to life. \u201cIn general, the L\u2019Rain live show is intense,\u201d Cheek told us. \u201cSometimes it feels like I\u2019ve absorbed the energy of the city over the past few years and poured it back out all at once. It\u2019s like my music is a vessel for all of the anxiety, the frustration, and the fear, but also the hope and sense of togetherness, all at once.\u201d L\u2019Rain CREDIT: Ellen Maurer When asked about working with Abdurraqib, L\u2019Rain said she admired him because, \u201cSometimes it feels like there are a lot of people in the music industry who don\u2019t actually like music\u201d but that \u201ctalking to Hanif it becomes extremely clear that he comes to music, first and foremost, from a place of love and deep study.\u201d According to Abdurraqib, that deep love and study, is what led him to curate a show that answered the question, \u201cWhat can I be a witness to that will surprise me?\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been to so many shows in my life,\u201d the music critic said. \u201cHonestly, even before the pandemic, my enthusiasm about going to shows dwindled. Not because people aren\u2019t putting on incredible live shows, but, there was a point in my late teens and early 20s where I was going to six shows a week.\u201d Hanif Abdurraqib introduces performance at BAM CREDIT: Edwina Hay He added: \u201cI\u2019m at a point now where I would like to see someone willing to take a risk. How can someone do something that pushes them beyond a place of comfort? Not in a way that\u2019s unsettling, but in a way that breaks through to the other side. I believe live performance is an exchange, so we all breakthrough that side together.\u201d The series of curated concerts continue from May 19 \u2013 June 11 with Omar Offendum\u2019s musical Little Syria, followed by a performance from Mavis Staples joined by Amy Helm on May 20, and a performance by Nikki Giovanni on June 11.

After sharing a dazzling first trailer for the production late last year, ABBA have now revealed four new photos \u2013 one for each \u201cdigital\u201d member of the band: Agnetha F\u00e4ltskog, Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus, Benny Andersson and Anni-Frid Lyngstad. You can see the impressively lifelike avatars here:   Last September, the \u2018Voyage\u2019 show producers spoke to NME about what to expect from what they described as a \u201cmagical space circus\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a concert on steroids, basically,\u201d explained Ludwig Andersson. \u201cHowever technically advanced these avatars are, this can never only be about technology. Like all music, you need to keep that open highway into your soul. We need to work on that emotion. \u201cIt needs to always be about the audience feeling something. We\u2019re just trying to enhance that feeling and crank it up to 11 with everything we have at our disposal.\u201d The upcoming \u2018Voyage\u2019 gigs will see the so-called \u2018ABBAtars\u2019 performing alongside a 10-piece live band (put together\u00a0with the help of Klaxons\u2019 James Righton and featuring Little Boots) at a new purpose-built 3,000-capacity venue called ABBA Arena. Speaking to\u00a0NME about her involvement in the ambitious project, Little Boots (aka Victoria Hesketh) said it had been \u201cabsolutely mind-blowing\u201d to work with ABBA, describing herself as a \u201cmega-fan\u201d of the group. \u201cI\u2019m a big disco fan so I\u2019m glad that\u2019s gone full circle to be recognised for its songwriting,\u201d she explained. \u201cABBA are a legendary part of the fabric of our artistic history now.\u201d In a separate interview, Righton told NME: \u201cIt was a challenge, but a fun one. I care as a fan of their band. If I was going to be a part of it, I wanted to get it right. This band had to step up as being as good as the original line-up.\u201d Bj\u00f6rn Ulvaeus recently said that he thinks ABBA\u2019s comeback is an \u201cimmense risk\u201d, adding: \u201cSometimes I wake up at four in the morning and think, \u2018What the hell have we done?'\u201d Ulvaeus told The Sunday Times that he expected other musicians to be watching the \u2018Voyage\u2019 show closely. \u201cLots of artists are going to be studying us, definitely,\u201d he said. \u201cI won\u2019t name names, but I can think of a few. \u201cI wonder who\u2019s going to be first. I couldn\u2019t possibly comment.\u201d  \u2018ABBA Voyage\u2019 kicks off on May 27 at the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London \u2013 you can find tickets and further information here. "

She was also known for her sarcastic and comedic stage presence. Henske was reportedly the inspiration for the title character in Annie Hall, whose director Woody Allen shared a stage with her in the 1960s. Judy Henske circa 1970 (Picture: Michael Ochs Archives/Getty Images) One of her best known songs, 1963\u2019s \u2018High Flying Bird\u2019, was particularly influential in folk-rock, and was notably covered by Jefferson Airplane. It was also the inspiration behind the name of Noel Gallagher\u2018s post-Oasis project. After finding early success with a slot on the early 1960s variety show Hootenanny, Henske joined The Whiskeyhill Singers with whom she recorded her first album. Among her most acclaimed releases was 1969\u2019s psychedelic \u2018Farewell Aldebaran\u2019, recorded with her then-husband Jerry Yester and released via Frank Zappa\u2018s Straight Records. They went on to form a short-lived band Rosebud, and released an eponymous follow-up in 1971. Henske then largely retired from public life, focussing on songwriting and raising her daughter. In the 1990s she returned to live performance, and released two final albums \u2013 1999\u2019s \u2018Loose In The World\u2019 and 2004\u2019s \u2018She Sang California\u2019.

Hustwit has previously worked on films about Mavis Staples (Mavis!) and Wilco (I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco). The filmmaker\u2019s official website now features a page for a documentary called Eno, which is described as \u201cthe definitive career-spanning, multi-platform documentary about visionary musician and artist Brian Eno\u201d. Hustwit was given access to hundreds of hours of previously unseen footage and unreleased music from Eno\u2019s archive to make the doc, which will be released in multiple versions and \u201cwill employ groundbreaking generative technology in its creation and exhibition\u201d. Brian Eno. CREDIT: Cecily Eno The director and his team have digitised and restored approximately 400 hours of material spanning 50 years, including interviews, early video art projects, lectures, performances, behind-the-scenes footage of recording sessions and more \u2013 most of which have not been released publicly before. Eno represents the latest collaboration in the legendary musician and filmmakers\u2019 creative relationship. Eno previously created the score for the documentary Rams in 2017, which explored the life of the German designer Dieter Rams. The film will, according to Hustwit\u2019s website, \u201coffer a deep dive into subjects that Eno has been notably passionate about, such as sustainability, social equity, and the future of civilisation, while centring above all on the nature of creativity\u201d. \u201cMuch of Brian\u2019s career has been about enabling creativity in himself and others, through his role as a producer but also through his collaborations on projects like the Oblique Strategies cards or the music app Bloom,\u201d Hustwit said. \u201cI think of Eno as an art film about creativity, with the output of Brian\u2019s 50-year career as its raw material. \u201cYou can\u2019t make a conventional, by-the-numbers bio-doc about Brian Eno. That would be antithetical and a missed opportunity. What I\u2019m trying to do is to create a cinematic experience that\u2019s as innovative as Brian\u2019s approach to music and art.\u201d  Last year, Eno spoke out about his feelings on the current NFT craze, saying it allows artists to be \u201clittle capitalist assholes\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve been approached several times to \u2018make an NFT,\u2019\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cSo far nothing has convinced me that there is anything worth making in that arena. \u2018Worth making\u2019 for me implies bringing something into existence that adds value to the world, not just to a bank account.\u201d "

The Saturday Night Live comedian was introducing the rapper to the stage, and first shared an antidote about the time they both lived at his \u201cmom\u2019s house\u201d. \u201cThis next guy that\u2019s coming to the stage, we celebrated Christmas together in 2018 and we both looked at each other from across the table,\u201d Davidson said, adding: \u201cWe were at my mom\u2019s house, we were living together at my mom\u2019s house, in her basement.\u201d He continued: \u201cI remember we were looking at each other like, \u2018It\u2019s OK, our careers are fucking over it\u2019s fine.\u2019 We had fun it\u2019s all good who would have thought we could do anything, right?'\u201d Pete went on to say that \u201cthis guy now has two No. 1 albums in a row, he\u2019s I think one of the biggest names you can get,\u201d before welcoming Machine Gun Kelly to the stage.  At another point during his set, Davidson brought up claims that Kanye West tried to spread rumours about Davidson \u2013 who is currently dating West\u2019s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian \u2013 having AIDS. \u201cI had an AIDS scare this year,\u201d he quipped (per Variety), telling his audience that he got himself tested for the condition since West is a \u201cgenius\u201d. He assured fans that he does not, in fact, have AIDS \u2013 he just looks like he does. Davidson reportedly went on to talk about feeling stuck when it came to responding to West\u2019s harassment, with none of the people in his inner circle able to give him advice on the situation.

In December 2020, the musician \u2013 real name Tahliah Barnett \u2013 sued the actor, accusing him of \u201crelentless abuse\u201d during their relationship. Now, the case will be heard before a jury in a Los Angeles court next year, with the trial currently set to start on April 17, 2023, Rolling Stone reports. A remote hearing in the case was heard in June 2021. At that time, Barnett\u2019s lawyer told a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge that \u201cthe parties have been engaged in productive settlement negotiations and are in the process of arranging for an early mediation\u201d. The judge then allowed time for the musician and the actor to work out a settlement out of court, setting a follow-up court date for December 2021.

Barnett has claimed that, during a relationship lasting just over a year, LaBeouf abused her physically, emotionally and mentally multiple times. \u201cI\u2019d like to be able to raise awareness on the tactics that abusers use to control you and take away your agency,\u201d she told the New York Times when her allegations were first made public. LaBeouf initially responded to claims from Barnett and another former partner, Karolyn Pho, in an email to the New York Times. \u201cI\u2019m not in any position to tell anyone how my behaviour made them feel,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI have no excuses for my alcoholism or aggression, only rationalisations. I have been abusive to myself and everyone around me for years. I have a history of hurting the people closest to me. I\u2019m ashamed of that history and am sorry to those I hurt. There is nothing else I can say.\u201d Shia LaBeouf CREDIT: Emma McIntyre/Getty Images for HFA He added that \u201cmany of these allegations are not true\u201d but said that he owed the women \u201cthe opportunity to air their statements publicly and accept accountability for those things I have done\u201d. In February 2021, he denied Barnett\u2019s allegations, stating through his lawyers that he denied \u201ceach and every\u201d claim from the musician, including causing her \u201cany injury or loss\u201d. He added that she is not \u201centitled to any relief or damages whatsoever\u201d. "

Tonight (May 4) Death Cab took to social media to post a photograph of themselves in a large recording studio. \u201cNew album done,\u201d the group wrote as the caption, telling fans that the first slice of new music from the full-length project will arrive next Wednesday (May 11). They also added a link to pre-save the as-yet-untitled track. Check out the post below.  A post shared by Death Cab for Cutie (@deathcabforcutie)  Speaking to NME in March 2021, frontman Ben Gibbard explained that his then-new signature Fender Mustang guitar had been inspiring Death Cab\u2019s next LP. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of songs and I\u2019m really happy with the material,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure a lot of musicians say that their new material is the best thing they\u2019ve ever done and try to hype it up. I don\u2019t want to give it that weight, but I can say that I\u2019m really excited about it. I think it\u2019s going to be a really good record.\u201d The musician went on to say that the music that the band were working on at that time saw him reflect on his own life and mortality amid the COVID-19 pandemic. \u201cThere is a theme of the loss of time and the finite amount of it that we all have,\u201d Gibbard told NME. \u201cThis last year of our lives has put a fine point on the fact that we are all mortal and only here for a brief period of time. It goes by quicker than you think.\u201d He added: \u201cLove and death are always big things for me, but there\u2019s a new component about how quickly time moves and how impermanent our existence here truly is.\u201d  Death Cab For Cutie are due to play a run of US headline shows this summer, with an additional date scheduled for New York\u2019s Forest Hills Stadium on September 30. You can purchase any remaining tickets here. Gibbard and co. recently performed at the New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival and Shaky Knees 2022. Upcoming festival appearances include Corona Capital in Mexico and Summerfest in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Rod Stewart surprised drinkers at a pub in Glasgow on Sunday, by stepping behind the bar to serve pints to locals. \u201cGreat to have spare bartender Rod \u2018the mod\u2019 Stewart tonight!\u201d said a post on the pub\u2019s social media channels, along with a photo of the veteran musician speaking to locals. Stewart, a superfan of Glasgow football team Celtic, had been to see his team\u2019s draw with Rangers in the Old Firm Derby hours earlier along with Scottish singer-songwriter John McLaughlin.  A post shared by The Dirty Duchess (@thedirtyduchessglasgow)  \u00a0 \u00a0 Stewart had also been joined by two of his sons, Alastair and Aiden, but not his son Sean, with whom he recently pleaded guilty to battery\u00a0over an altercation with a security guard at a Florida hotel in 2019. The musician and his son, Sean, entered guilty pleas to a misdemeanour count of \u201csimple battery\u201d but will not face jail, pay a fine nor go on probation. The judge withheld adjudication, which means the pair have not been formally convicted. Rod and Sean were accused of assault on New Year\u2019s Eve 2019 when they were refused access to a private event at Breakers Palm Beach Hotel, according to a police report. Sean, 41, allegedly shoved the security guard and Rod, 76, struck his chest \u201cwith a closed fist\u201d.  Elsewhere, Stewart recently revealed why he was absent from the Live Aid line-up in 1985, stating that he had \u201conly just found out\u201d the real reason. \u201cWe actually were supposed to do it,\u201d he told the\u00a0BBC, \u201cbut a few guys in the band told me that our ex-manager turned it down because I wasn\u2019t getting the right news coverage.

Davidson shared the story during his first stand-up gig in three years, at Los Angeles live\u00a0 Netflix comedy festival on Friday (April 29). The Saturday Night Live comedian was introducing the rapper to the stage, and first shared an antidote about the time they both lived at his \u201cmom\u2019s house\u201d. \u201cThis next guy that\u2019s coming to the stage, we celebrated Christmas together in 2018 and we both looked at each other from across the table,\u201d Davidson said, adding: \u201cWe were at my mom\u2019s house, we were living together at my mom\u2019s house, in her basement.\u201d He continued: \u201cI remember we were looking at each other like, \u2018It\u2019s OK, our careers are fucking over it\u2019s fine.\u2019 We had fun it\u2019s all good who would have thought we could do anything, right?'\u201d Pete went on to say that \u201cthis guy now has two No. 1 albums in a row, he\u2019s I think one of the biggest names you can get,\u201d before welcoming Machine Gun Kelly to the stage.  At another point during his set, Davidson brought up claims that Kanye West tried to spread rumours about Davidson \u2013 who is currently dating West\u2019s ex-wife, Kim Kardashian \u2013 having AIDS. \u201cI had an AIDS scare this year,\u201d he quipped (per Variety), telling his audience that he got himself tested for the condition since West is a \u201cgenius\u201d. He assured fans that he does not, in fact, have AIDS \u2013 he just looks like he does. Davidson reportedly went on to talk about feeling stuck when it came to responding to West\u2019s harassment, with none of the people in his inner circle able to give him advice on the situation.  Later this month, Davidson will star in MGK\u2019s directorial debut, Good Mourning, as an aggressive valet driver. The film will be out on May 20 \u2013 see the first trailer here. Later in the year \u2013 on August 5, to be exact \u2013 Davidson will star alongside Amandla Stenberg and Maria Bakalova in the comedy-horror film Bodies Bodies Bodies. Meanwhile, Kelly recently hinted he could return to rap on his next album after a successful pivot to becoming a pop-punk star. 2020\u2019s \u2018Tickets To My Downfall\u2019 gave him his first US Number One album and his first within the pop-punk genre after appearing to ditch his rap career. It was followed up by his album \u2018Mainstream Sellout\u2019, which was released in March. "

            "content": "Chester Bennington\u2018s pre-Linkin Park band, Grey Daze, have shared the first episode of their documentary series. Watch the first episode below. The four-part series, called\u00a0Grey Daze: Creation of the Phoenix, follows the band from their origins in the \u201990s up to their yet-to-be-released LP, \u2018The Phoenix\u2019. The record, which is set to come out on June 17, features re-mastered vocals from Bennington. The Linkin Park frontman left Grey Daze back in 1998, but had reunited with them and was in the middle of re-recording music for a new album when he died in 2017. The band have shared the first episode of the docu-series, which features footage of Bennington and his bandmates playing together at their start, before getting into their experience of making \u2018The Phoenix\u2019, a follow-up to their 2020 album \u2018Amends\u2018, which also featured re-mastered vocals from Bennington\u2019s.  \u2018The Phoenix\u2019 will be a 10-song collection intended to honour the late singer, with contributions from Dave Navarro, Richard Patrick and Bennington\u2019s daughters, Lily and Lila Bennington. \u201c\u2019Amends\u2019 was more emotional and reflective,\u201d Graze drummer Sean Dowdell said about the band\u2019s coming release. \u201cWe felt sad when we were writing it. Now that we\u2019re a couple of years removed, it\u2019s very clear what we were going through. We were at a different stage of grief. We went through the shock and the sadness. Now, we\u2019re back to gratitude.\u201d Dowdell added: \u201c\u2018The Phoenix\u2019 is more of a celebration of our friend, his talent, and the music. It captures Chester\u2019s angst and energy that people fell in love with. It\u2019s much more aggressive. If you love Chester\u2019s scream, you\u2019ll love this record.\u201d  In a four-star review of \u2018Amends\u2019 NME said, \u201crather than dwell on loss, \u2018Amends\u2019 celebrates the wild extremes of living\u201d adding that it is \u201ca great modern rock record fronted by one of the best vocalists in the game.\u201d \u201c\u2018Amends\u2019 echoes the raw angst that made Chester a superstar with those early Linkin Park albums but also leans into his desire to speak to as many people as possible. Adding to his legacy but dealing in more than cheap nostalgia, \u2018Amends\u2019 is a powerful record that offers comfort, motivation and a sense of belonging.\u201d "
