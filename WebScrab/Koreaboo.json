            "content": "NCTzens were excited to hear NCT\u2018s Johnny would be attending the\u00a0Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute\u2018s\u00a02022 Met Gala (also known as\u00a0Met Ball) during his NYC trip. NCT\u2019s Johnny | @NCTsmtown/Twitter It was especially anticipated as he practically manifested it years ago. one thing 127's gonna do is manifest the hell out of something and have it come true in 2-3 years' time https://t.co/yr5j1UYCXC \u2014 \ud83c\udfae JOHNNY AT THE MET (@waenjivillain) May 2, 2022  He joins EXO\u2018s Lay, PSY, Rain, and Super Junior\u2018s Siwon as the fifth male K-Pop idol to grace the annual star-studded event. Johnny is now the 5th Kpop male idol to attend Met Gala after Rain, Psy, Siwon and Lay.

The stories really reflect the evolution of American style, but they also explore the work of individual tailors, dress-makers, and designers. \u2026We\u2019ve been exploring untold stories and focusing on designers who have been almost written out of fashion history because they weren\u2019t commercially successful or they had a short career span, but at the time had a big impact on American fashion. \u2014 Andrew Bolton, Met Gala\u00a0Curator and Coordinator Is #Johnny wearing a simple look? Yes! However, it\u2018s the modernized version of the theme by utilizing regality and wealth in fabrics and cuts. That\u2018s what Peter Do wants his brand to be known for \u2013 redefining modern luxury! #MetGala pic.twitter.com/q3cEb8So2H \u2014 \u039b L E X \ud83d\udddd\ud83d\udda4 (@alexanderbihn) May 2, 2022  Despite the celebratory event on the particular awareness month, Johnny still became the victim of racism that night. Johnny arrived at The 2022 Met Gala looking fine AF, just as expected. JOHNNY IS SO HANDSOME #MetGala #NCT127 #PETERDO #JOHNNY pic.twitter.com/NItoGx45ut \u2014 Met Insider (REAL) (@feIixs) May 2, 2022  The paparazzi directed the celebrities to pose for photos on the red carpet. Being in a crowd of people with so much noise, especially with cameras and flashes going off, can be overwhelming, and one can\u2019t hear everything. Still, one paparazzi got especially impatient. Johnny from @NCTsmtown just said hi to us at the #MetGala and I'm freaking out! pic.twitter.com/8kopnZR6G5 \u2014 Teen Vogue (@TeenVogue) May 3, 2022  After directing Johnny to move so that he could get a better picture, one paparazzi became annoyed when the K-Pop idol did not change his pose immediately. Johnny Suh, over here! On this side, please! \u2014 Paparazzi Your browser does not support video. Thus the man muttered, \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand a word I\u2019m saying.\u201d He assumed that since Johnny was not responding to his direction immediately and was Asian, he must not understand English. He doesn\u2019t understand a word I\u2019m saying. F*ck. \u2014 Paparazzi Your browser does not support video. The original poster of the video\u00a0@dygenre didn\u2019t realize until after their video went viral that the man next to them had said something racist about Johnny. oh my god the audio for the video i didn\u2019t even realize he said that i was so focused on johnny \u2014 eden \u2192 met suhla (@dygenre) May 2, 2022  i hope everyone knows i\u2019m not the one talking in the video \ud83e\udd15 \u2014 eden \u2192 met suhla (@dygenre) May 2, 2022  Originally, the NCTzen posted the video expressing their excitement about seeing Johnny. JOHNNY I LOVE YOU SO MUCH #MetGala #MetGala2022 #JOHNNY #NCT127 pic.twitter.com/GI0AZAnacJ \u2014 eden \u2192 met suhla (@dygenre) May 2, 2022  Yet, shortly after posting, the video blew up but for unfortunate reasons as viewers noticed the audio including the paparrazzi\u2019s racist remark.  Netizens were shocked to hear such a racist remark made especially considering Johnny is from Chicago, Illinois, and therefore is fluent in English. Nctzen or not, anyone can see how disrespectful that reporter/paparazzi was to Johnny. Racism and xenophobia is a problem idols face everytime they go to America \u2014 nr- JOHNNYS SECURITY (@214yongss) May 2, 2022  Like im gonna need the name of this man to get his job taken from him im being serious, how\u2019s he allowed to work in the industry and have enough confidence to say this straight up ?? pic.twitter.com/0W97pfIl3H \u2014 nr- JOHNNYS SECURITY (@214yongss) May 2, 2022  Nevertheless, it was xenophobic to assume that he could not understand English just because Johnny is Asian. yes, but assuming that bc he's asian/is a kpop idol he doesn't understand english IS the xenophobic part, especially in this case bc johnny is literally an american citizen \ud83d\udc80 \u2014 babb\u2077\u1d5b\u00b9\u00b2\u2077\u2194\u2726\u221e (@bealbobe) May 3, 2022  Netizens are also pointing out that the paparazzi in question also mispronounced Johnny\u2019s name despite Suh being straightforward to pronounce. *Mispronounces his name * \u201c he doesn\u2019t understand a word I\u2019m saying\u201d FIRSTLY PUT SOME RESPECT ON HIS NAME\u2026UR TAKING PHOTOS OF HIM SECONDLY ITS THREE LETTERS HOWW?!! THIRDLY HE IS AMERICAN DO A LITTLE RESEARCH OF U WANT A PHOTO SO BADLY \u2014 BUSHRA (@BUSHI_101) May 3, 2022  Naturally, the video went viral on both Twitter and TikTok just a couple of hours after the original posting. The original video has over 300K views on Twitter. NCTzen MARKSTAGRAM (@lomlmkl on TikTok) shared it on TikTok, and it garnered 16.8K views in just two hours. once nctzen find his ass, hes for the streets #johnnysuh #metgala #fyp #fyp\u30b7 #lomlmkl  \u266c original sound \u2013 MARKSTAGRAM    | @lomlmkl/TikTok The original poster of the video was able to identify the paparazzi as Erwyn Diaz. The man requested Johnny\u2019s Instagram handle in order to tag him, which many found quite ironic. the only reason i have it is because he later asked me for johnny\u2019s ig to tag him in his story and then asked for mine \u2014 eden \u2192 met suhla (@dygenre) May 2, 2022  It is disheartening that anyone has to hear such ignorant and racist remarks. Unfortunately, since COVID-19 especially, there has been a rise in anti-Asian rhetoric and hate crimes in America. Many Asian American idols have been troubled about it as they have family there or even live there themselves, such as Eric Nam and GOT7\u2018s Mark Tuan.\u00a0Not only that, but the lack of acceptance for Asians in the Western entertainment industry is a primary reason why Eric decided to travel to South Korea to begin a career in music. Eric Nam | EN Management  Thankfully, Johnny also met lots of fans the night of The 2022 Met Gala. So, hopefully, their love drowns out any hate and bigotry he may have overheard.

Three years ago, an interviewer told Johnny that his \u201cEnglish was phenomenal.\u201d Though, the interviewer in question has since apologized. the interviewer said johnny\u2019s english was \u201cphenomenal\u201d as if he isn\u2019t a wholeass american johnny even said \u201ci\u2019m from chicago\u201d right after that pic.twitter.com/blBGKHn5xK \u2014 johnny doing things\u00b2\u2079 (@johnactivities) May 15, 2019  Similarly, a video went viral of a man being racist towards BLACKPINK\u2018s Ros\u00e9 also in New York City.

Jackson | @jacksonwang852g7/Instagram As he spent most of his life training and competing in fencing, but left abruptly to pursue his true dream of being a musician in Korea, his parents were understandably worried, and Jackson recently shared their true first reaction to his audition for JYPE!  Jackson recently appeared on The Kelly Clarkson Show as a guest, alongside actor Jake Johnson and American comedian Natasha Leggero. During the show, Kelly Clarkson asked Jackson about his journey from almost-Olympian athlete to a rapper and dancer in GOT7. Jackson talked about his past, and even talked about the way he broke the news of his audition to his parents back then! I was prepping for the London Olympics back then, and then, while prepping, I just told my parents, \u2018Hey, I always had this dream about music\u2026let me do my thing!\u2019 \u2014Jackson Your browser does not support video.

They were like, \u2018You\u2019re out of your mind!\u2019 My principal told me that \u2018This is the worst decision you\u2019re ever gonna make in your life\u2019.
