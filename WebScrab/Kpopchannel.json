The group\u2019s slogan of \u2018WE ARE CONNECTED\u2019 emphasizes their strong connection with their fans with whom they hope to share countless memories. The concept of YOUNI-BIRTH is a project that focuses on introducing YOUNITE through a universe-themed storyline. The tracks from the YOUNI-BIRTH feature various producers, including BOOMBASTIC, OUOW, LISH, nomad, and On the Road. One of the group\u2019s members, DEY, was also involved in writing the lyrics and all of the raps on the tracks. Their main title track is \u201c1 of 9\u201d, a nu-disco pop song with an accompanying music video that highlights each member individually so that their fans can select their personal bias. "

            "content": " John OFA Rhee has finally released his first-ever studio album, bleeding in sunset blvd. on July 14th. In addition to his two previous releases, bleeding in, and sunset blvd. \u2013 four new songs will be added to complete his first-ever 12-track physical release. After releasing sunset blvd. in June, Rhee spares no time in introducing the final page of his musical journal.   \u201cSHOULD I\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a song I wrote in high school,\u201d Rhee states of the jazz standard like \u201cSHOULD I\u201d, a song that contains a slow groove throughout chords full of tensions and releases. He changed the song\u2019s lyrics, tempo, and feel throughout the years and finally came to a finish in the summer of 2020. \u201cSome people might remember it as a totally different song,\u201d says Rhee, hinting to the listeners that the song they remember might come to them as an entirely new experience.\u00a0 Rhee will also be releasing a video teamed up with \u201cXuck Film\u201d, painting a story of a man through an introspective journey, finding his true identity. Just like Rhee\u2019s production, the video is constructed fully of easter-egg-like details that might beg viewers hunting for more.\u00a0  \u201cBETTER THAN HE CAN\u201d \u201cI honestly just wanted 808\u2019s on a solid drum groove, says Rhee, of the hip-hop ballad tune \u2013 a song that anybody that had a crush before could relate to. \u201cI wrote this while it was pouring outside. You can hear, smell and see the rain flooding down, you could almost touch and feel the raindrops that are attached to your windows. You\u2019re so close to the rain, yet it\u2019s like you\u2019re so distanced from it.\u201d Once Rhee found the right sounds to go with the feeling, he wrote the lyrics as if he was writing to a friend of his. \u201cThe music had a story of its own, I just added my two cents to it,\u201d says Rhee, his favorite lyric being \u201cI don\u2019t want you to say \u201cSorry\u201d and I don\u2019t want me to say \u201cPlease\u201d.\u00a0 \u201cBABY BABY\u201d \u201cThe most vulnerable song\u201d is how Rhee describes \u201cBABY BABY\u201d as he confesses that he wrote the lyrics fully intoxicated on a late summer night in Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s like a photo you take when you\u2019re drunk, having it completely leave your memory only for you to find it the next morning,\u201d says Rhee, stating that he had to contemplate for weeks if he should add this song to the final tracklist.\u00a0 The track itself is full of colors that jump in and out especially when the atmosphere created by the reverb gets sucked out during the chorus, as Rhee whispers his lyrics out in desperation.\u00a0 \u201cSLUMBER\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI believe every instrument has its own story to tell,\u201d says Rhee describing how \u201cSLUMBER\u201d was influenced by the grand piano in the studio Rhee was staying at to finish up the album. The grand piano echoes in a warm, melancholy mood accompanied by a saxophone solo from Jean Chirac of the band Ash Rock. Rhee stated that this was a whole new song that was added to the album at the last minute, \u201cI literally drowned in this song for 3 whole days, as if I was stuck in some kind of trance \u2013 trying to finish and record the song\u201d. \u201cSLUMBER\u201d is a conclusion, somewhat of a resolution of a sorrowful love story \u2013 depicting a soul longing and following after another lost soul. Concluding Rhee\u2019s first-ever studio album bleeding in sunset blvd..

            "title": "John OFA Rhee Shares First Studio Album < bleeding in sunset blvd. >",
            "content": " John OFA Rhee has finally released his first-ever studio album, bleeding in sunset blvd. on July 14th. In addition to his two previous releases, bleeding in, and sunset blvd. \u2013 four new songs will be added to complete his first-ever 12-track physical release. After releasing sunset blvd. in June, Rhee spares no time in introducing the final page of his musical journal.   \u201cSHOULD I\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a song I wrote in high school,\u201d Rhee states of the jazz standard like \u201cSHOULD I\u201d, a song that contains a slow groove throughout chords full of tensions and releases. He changed the song\u2019s lyrics, tempo, and feel throughout the years and finally came to a finish in the summer of 2020. \u201cSome people might remember it as a totally different song,\u201d says Rhee, hinting to the listeners that the song they remember might come to them as an entirely new experience.\u00a0 Rhee will also be releasing a video teamed up with \u201cXuck Film\u201d, painting a story of a man through an introspective journey, finding his true identity. Just like Rhee\u2019s production, the video is constructed fully of easter-egg-like details that might beg viewers hunting for more.\u00a0  \u201cBETTER THAN HE CAN\u201d \u201cI honestly just wanted 808\u2019s on a solid drum groove, says Rhee, of the hip-hop ballad tune \u2013 a song that anybody that had a crush before could relate to. \u201cI wrote this while it was pouring outside. You can hear, smell and see the rain flooding down, you could almost touch and feel the raindrops that are attached to your windows. You\u2019re so close to the rain, yet it\u2019s like you\u2019re so distanced from it.\u201d Once Rhee found the right sounds to go with the feeling, he wrote the lyrics as if he was writing to a friend of his. \u201cThe music had a story of its own, I just added my two cents to it,\u201d says Rhee, his favorite lyric being \u201cI don\u2019t want you to say \u201cSorry\u201d and I don\u2019t want me to say \u201cPlease\u201d.\u00a0 \u201cBABY BABY\u201d \u201cThe most vulnerable song\u201d is how Rhee describes \u201cBABY BABY\u201d as he confesses that he wrote the lyrics fully intoxicated on a late summer night in Los Angeles. \u201cIt\u2019s like a photo you take when you\u2019re drunk, having it completely leave your memory only for you to find it the next morning,\u201d says Rhee, stating that he had to contemplate for weeks if he should add this song to the final tracklist.\u00a0 The track itself is full of colors that jump in and out especially when the atmosphere created by the reverb gets sucked out during the chorus, as Rhee whispers his lyrics out in desperation.\u00a0 \u201cSLUMBER\u201d\u00a0 \u201cI believe every instrument has its own story to tell,\u201d says Rhee describing how \u201cSLUMBER\u201d was influenced by the grand piano in the studio Rhee was staying at to finish up the album. The grand piano echoes in a warm, melancholy mood accompanied by a saxophone solo from Jean Chirac of the band Ash Rock. Rhee stated that this was a whole new song that was added to the album at the last minute, \u201cI literally drowned in this song for 3 whole days, as if I was stuck in some kind of trance \u2013 trying to finish and record the song\u201d. \u201cSLUMBER\u201d is a conclusion, somewhat of a resolution of a sorrowful love story \u2013 depicting a soul longing and following after another lost soul.

            "content": "\u00a0Los Angeles, CA \u2013 July 20, 2020 \u2013 A new wave of sound has arrived! Influential, global icon and China\u2019s top superstar LAY (Lay Zhang) drops his final component of the\u00a0LIT\u00a0album today, by Zhang Yixing Studio, which comes to completion with the final six songs for the twelve-track album. Following the record-breaking success of the first six songs of\u00a0LIT, LAY continues to bridge two cultures and two sounds in an astonishing cross-cultural blend, while showcasing his personal growth in his artistry. LAY most recently released the perfect summer anthem\u00a0BOOM,\u00a0where LAY gracefully forged together tropical and hip-hop elements. To date, the first part of the album surpassed over 13 million streams and the music video for LIT has been viewed more than 10 million times.  LAY creates a sensational, cross-cultural music style all of his own by using traditional Chinese instruments and modern hip-hop beats for a new innovative sound interlaced with English and Mandarin lyrics. Each of the tracks was co-written and co-produced by LAY\u00a0himself to ensure his message and story is clearly infused in each song. For the full album, LAY teamed up with GRAMMY Award-winning producers Scott Storch\u00a0(50 Cent, Beyonc\u00e9, DJ Khaled, Snoop Dogg)\u00a0and Murda Beatz\u00a0(Travis Scott, Gucci Mane, Drake)\u00a0to finish his vision.\u00a0LIT\u00a0is LAY\u2019s final contribution to his groundbreaking cross-cultural hip-hop album that has been highly-awaited by fans. LISTEN TO THE FULL ALBUM \u201cLIT\u201d BY LAY \u201c\u84ee\u201d- translated to\u00a0LIT\u00a0in English describes a Chinese religious belief of the duality of \u201cLife & Death\u201d. The \u201cLotus Flower\u201d is also used by the same Chinese character as it\u2019s a cultural icon recognized as something that \u201cgrows and blossoms out of the dirt/mud\u201d. This paints a perfect metaphor of LAY\u2019s album; firstly, the duality of a two-part release, and secondly it represents a new birth plus a new sound in the midst of all his past achievements. Through the songs, LAY explores the concepts of solitude, arrogance, self-confidence, loyalty, resolution and courage. These twelve songs blend very ancient musical elements and concepts with the modernity of contemporary pop. From the lyrics, to the production, be prepared for an emotional and auditory journey. The cutting edge production for newly released songs like\u00a0Changsha,\u00a0Mama,\u00a0Call My Name,\u00a0Late Night, and\u00a0Wish\u00a0will give you a very cross-cultural and refreshing journey as the combination of traditional \u201cpeking opera\u201d and Chinese instruments are showcased through passionate lyrics showing a whole new blend of music.  LAY received tremendous success this year garnering international attention after joining forces with Steve Aoki and\u00a0will.i.am\u00a0for the hit cross-cultural collaboration\u00a0Love You More,\u00a0reaching #1 on the QQ Music China chart. He became a household name in Asia and one of the most beloved stars in the region with a loyal 49.5 million followers on Weibo and over 12 million followers on Instagram. As a solo artist, LAY\u2019s career has skyrocketed from tremendous success becoming the highest-ranked Mandopop star on Billboard 200 chart and the first Chinese artist to enter the iTunes Top 60 in the US with his third album\u00a0NAMANANA. The pre-order for Lay Zhang\u2019s new digital album\u00a0LIT\u00a0went live on China\u2019s QQ Music platform, and 9 certification records were instantly broken as it went live. The digital album surpassed 1.5 million pre-orders within 7 minutes and 19 seconds of launch, locking in the #1 position on QQ Music\u2019s daily and weekly album sales chart. The music video and EP for\u00a0LIT\u00a0went on to break records for a Chinese artist. In 24 hours, LAY received over 1.6 million views on his YouTube channel, and over 5 million views in four and a half days on the music video for\u00a0LIT. Organically, LAY received over 100 reaction videos on YouTube within a week of the music video\u2019s release, which led to 1 million subscribers in that same week on LAY\u2019s YouTube channel (officially June 6th).

            "title": "Big Hit Entertainment ready to commence IPO + BTS owning shares in the company.",
            "content": "Big Hit Entertainment, home to megastars BTS, who recently climbed to the No.1 position on Billboard\u2019s \u201cHOT 100\u201d list,\u00a0is ready to officially start off preparations to go public! On September 2nd, Big Hit Entertainment\u00a0announced their registration statement\u00a0for listing under the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) was filed with the Financial Services Commission (FSC). According to a regulatory filing, the company will be offering 7.13 million newly-issued stocks, at the price range of 105,000 won through 135,000 won (approx. $88- $114). Making the total estimated sum between 748.7 billion won to 962.6 billion won (approx. $630.7 million- $811 million). The figures for the company\u2019s estimated market capitalization amounts to a number between 3.55 trillion won and 4.57 trillion won (approx. $2.99 billion- $3.85 billion).  For my readers out there who are new to this, let\u2019s put this together in simple words. For a private company to go public refers to the process of selling shares to the public, which is the initial public offering (IPO). This is the transition of the company from private to public, thus becoming a publicly traded and owned entity. The KOSPI market is the main listing medium of the Korea Exchange (KRX). It is South Korea\u2019s represented stock market index and is considered the equivalent of the United States\u2019 S&P 500. Many large domestic and international companies such as Samsung Electronics, Hyundai Motor, KIA Motors, LG Electronics and POSCO are listed on KOSPI. Back in May 27th, Big Hit Entertainment filed for the preliminary screening of IPO, which gained approval from the Korea Exchange (KRX) on August 7th KST. Unlike its peers who are listed under KOSDAQ (Korea Securities Dealers Association Quotations), Big Hit Entertainment was approved for listing under the main KOSPI market. According to the Korea Exchange (KRX), Big Hit\u2019s IPO is arranged by NH Investment & Securities, Korea Investment & Securities, and JPMorgan Chase, with Mirae Asset Daewoo- Korea\u2019s largest investment banking and stock brokerage company, as a joint underwriter. On September 3rd, the Financial Supervisory Service\u2019s Data Analysis, Retrieval and Transfer System (DART), revealed Big Hit\u2019s IPO registration report which included statements on BTS member\u2019s military enlistment as well as the number of shares owned by the individual members. The registration statement disclosed that Bang Si Hyuk, Big Hit\u2019s founder, and chairman-CEO, gifted the septet a total of 478,695 shares, which amounts to 68,385 shares each. The company stated that this gesture of gifting the members a part of the shares was a step to \u201cstrengthen\u00a0their long-term cooperative relationship with the core artists and to\u00a0boost high morale\u00a0by sharing the results\u00a0of the company\u2019s growth.\u201d With this, the members of BTS will not only be artists under Big Hit but will also partake in owning the company\u2019s stocks. If the IPO share price is set at the maximum, i.e. 135,000 won (approx. $114), then each member of BTS will own shares valuing 9.23 billion won (approx. $7.78 million). With so much liquidity out there and so much momentum behind BTS, Big Hit Entertainment may end up pulling off Korea's biggest IPO in years. It's not chips, phones or cars anymore, but K-pop, games and pharmaceuticals that are fueling the market. https://t.co/QWe2juIPGR \u2014 Sam Kim (@samkimasia) September 2, 2020  One of the concerns that drew most attention regarding Big Hit\u2019s IPO, was the group\u2019s eldest member Jin\u2019s military enlistment. In the statement detailing the risks of investing in the company, Big Hit stated, \u201cBTS consists of members born between 1992 and 1997 who are required to enlist as active-duty soldiers. It has been assessed that it will be possible for the oldest member Kim Seok Jin (Jin) to delay his enlistment until the end of 2021, based on the military service law.\u201d In addition, the company also expressed their plans to enable the artists to continue earning revenues through indirect sources when they are unable to promote. The company stated, \u201cTo prepare for the risk of the artists suspending their activities due to military enlistment, illnesses, or accidents, the company is continuing to expand the ratio of revenue earned through products, that do not require direct participation from artists, such as merchandise, licensing and video content. To minimize the risk of reduced sales due to our core artists\u2019 impending hiatus from issues including military enlistment, we are reviewing a wide variety of business options such as pre-produced albums and video content as well as flexible operation of artists who are able to promote.\u201d On September 24th and 25th, Big Hit will proceed with the book building process, with the institutional investors from within and outside the country. The company will proceed to take the general subscriptions on October 5th and 6th, and are likely to complete the IPO listing process in the same month. Earlier this year, SK Biopharmaceuticals Co. raised $784 million becoming the largest Korean IPO in three years. With an estimated IPO of 962.6 billion won (approx. $811 million), Big Hit Entertainment might exceed the previously set record. As of the end of 2019, Bang Si Hyuk was the biggest shareholder of Big Hit Entertainment owning 45.12% shares, followed by the Korean gaming giant Netmarble Corp, headed by Bang\u2019s cousin Bang Jun Hyuk, owning 25.1%.  Founded in 2005 by producer Bang Si Hyuk, Big Hit Entertainment currently houses a total of three artists- BTS, TXT and Lee Hyun. The company has been diversely expanding its multi-label structure through new ventures in recent years. Some of which being the launch of Weverse,\u00a0a fan community platform developed and operated by Big Hit\u2019s subsidiary\u00a0beNX;\u00a0the\u00a0acquisition of multi-platform music game company Superb and entertainment company Source Music, which is home to girl group GFriend, all in 2019. In 2020, the company further acquired Pledis Entertainment whose current lineup includes boy groups\u00a0Seventeen and\u00a0NU\u2019EST. Currently,\u00a0Big Hit and CJ E&M\u2018s joint venture,\u00a0BELIFT LAB is\u00a0organizing a survival reality TV show I-LAND with plans to produce and launch a new boy group. \u00a0 Source : (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) [Image credits to the owner] "

It\u2019s always bigger than ever for them, every single time.A PH-based charity organization by PH-ARMYs,\u00a0Team AGTJ\u00a0(ARMYs Act of Generosity Turned Into Joy)\u00a0organized a BTS comeback project called\u00a0\u201cLOADER THAN BOMBS 2.0\u201d\u00a0along with 134 fanbases and partners to fund deserving PH-ARMYs for the upcoming comeback this month.The project aims to help fans who are financially tapped out to stream and enjoy the new music from\u00a0RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V\u00a0and\u00a0Jungkook. Not only that, this project will also help the fans reach the comeback goals for the group.BTS was known to be an underdog in K-industry; deprived of fair treatment and acknowledgement. And now that we have the resources and the power to show what the industry has been missing out, the team thought that this comeback will be the biggest resistance in the standardization of the music industry and for that we can\u2019t stop ARMYs from contributing their all to provide what is to be done\u2013recognition.

The initial target is to provide for 500 ARMYs who will be selected thoroughly from the application forms submitted. If the collected fund permits, the group will also purchase Spotify Premium and Youtube Premium subscriptions for the recipients for the sole purpose of streaming.\u00a0Actually, it started when Team AGTJ sent us a message saying that they are considering to team up with us. They were planning to fund us, especially our streamers, in terms of load expenses. Of course, who would refuse such offer if it is for the convenience of our streamers. So we agreed. The collab started when Team AGTJ reached and gather other fanbases, fanpages and groups to help with the project\u2019s promotion. CKS, as the beneficiary of LTB and with our sole project which aims to provide free premium streaming accounts, are doing their best not only as part of LTB but also to screen carefully the potential streamers that will receive the load from LTB. With CKS extending their goal, 500 slots were opened to cater 500 streamers where Team AGTJ will set their collected funds.This isn\u2019t our first project. CKS has been doing the same project since Persona era. This is our 4th project. We had a collab with @PHARMYPROJTEAM and Bangwool For Goals on our first project.

Dreamcatcher has garnered significant attention, even claiming the title of K-pop\u2019s first female act to hit #1 on Billboard\u2019s Next Big Sound Chart. It\u2019s not their first run on the Billboard Charts though, as the musical septet have ranked on the Billboard World Albums Chart and Billboard World Digital Song Sales Chart multiple times since their re-debut as Dreamcatcher in 2017 with hits like \u201c\ub370\uc790\ubd80 (Deju Vu)\u201d from their special mini-album Raid of Dream.  Sonically, they differ from most other K-Pop groups, choosing to take on a more pop-rock and metal sound that has gained them popularity globally. Their Dystopia trilogy of music releases dropped hits like \u201cScream\u201d and \u201cBOCA\u201d, that pushed the message of reflecting on the modern-day \u201cwitch hunt\u201d in today\u2019s technologically advanced society that is ripe with hate comments and \u2018cancel\u2019 culture. Their latest song, \u201cOdd Eye\u201d comes off the last installment of the trilogy, the sixth mini-album Dystopia: Road to Utopia. Their music video for the title track currently has 32 million views, cementing their position in the K-Pop wave as an influential artist. With their most recent online showcase and previous successful online concerts that brought in over 13,000 viewers per show, Dreamcatcher is ready to meet their fans, InSomnia [official fan club name] again for their third online concert.

Each night of the concert will show a different side of Dreamcatcher in their journey to close the Dystopia trilogy together with their fans. The title of the concert, [CROSSROADS], emphasizes the final place the group stands at the end of the storyline of their Dystopia trilogy as they searched for their Utopia in a neverending Dystopia. For this concert, Dreamcatcher continues their collaboration with MyMusicTaste, a technology-forward platform that breaks the barriers set by the pandemic and brings fans and artists together to create a new way of connection.

            "content": "The rhythm can be created through dancing, as tap dance; which is a performance art that relies on dancers creating catchy rhythms with their feet.Tap dance is known for its syncopated, catchy beats and improvisational choreography, which links it to jazz music.And you can find many dance studios that teach tap classes if you are interested in this type of dance and want to learn it.In this article, I will introduce to you a special interview with the professional tap dancer \u201cYono Lee\u201d CEO of YONO Company, Korea Tap Orchestra (KTO) Founder, Executive Director and Team Captain to tell us more about \u201cKTO\u201d, a professional tap dance group.One of the most prominent works of the group, \u201cYono\u201d was the lead tap dance choreographer for the movie \u2018Swing Kids\u2019 (\uc2a4\uc719\ud0a4\uc988) Starring EXO\u2019s Do Kyung-soo, they also choreographed for other films such as Yuwol, Bird Cage and delivered the opening show of the 2021 Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival (BIFAN), as well as the commercials like Outback in collaboration with Lia Kim, Maxim T.O.P., and Mongbest.Voil\u00e0 The Dialogue:Aya \u2013Q- At first, can you tell us more about \u201cKorea Tap Orchestra\u201d and when the troupe was founded?Yono -A- Korea Tap Orchestra (KTO) is a professional tap dance team that brings together top-level tap dancers from various studios in Korea. The group was founded in 2016 under the label YONO Company, a tap dance-based performing arts, and arts education company. I am its founder and artistic director \u201cYong-kap Park\u201d.We launched our signature tap concert called \u2018All That RHYTHM\u2019 in 2016 and we\u2019ve been performing and reinventing this show annually since then.Originally, tap dance is an American dance and music genre, a performing art that developed on par with jazz. At KTO we aim to reinterpret this genre by infusing it with Korean sentiments and adapting it to Korean music and rhythms. We want to create our own content and that can resonate with our local audience.Aya -Q- What kind of music do you dance to?Yono -A- Tap dance developed in close connection with jazz, so tap dancers not only in America but around the world typically train and perform on jazz rhythms: this is the classic form of tap. Of course, this is a key part of our training and repertory, and we are grateful for the deep heritage we received from U.S. tap legends. But we also wanted to bring something new into the genre, so we began to experiment with traditional Korean rhythms of gugak. In this way, we try to bring a Korean perspective to the genre and innovate by fusing the classic aspects of this art form with our own cultural background. This is an ongoing research for us.Aya -Q- How many hours per day or week do you spend practicing?Yono -A- Typically, we practice twice a week as a team and three or more times a week individually, for about two or three hours at a time. This would be the basic structure for us. But these days because of COVID-19 we can\u2019t have a group practice as often as we\u2019d like to, so we\u2019ve come to rely more on individual training.Aya -Q- How long does it take to become a professional tap dancer?Yono -A- It really depends on individual characteristics. For someone talented, with a good sense of rhythm, or who is experienced in other dance genres, it may go pretty fast. But generally speaking, for someone starting from scratch, it takes about 10 years to perform on stage comfortably as a professional tap dancer.Aya -Q- What are the most important skills that a tap dancer should have?Yono -A- The basic mechanism of tap dance is the creation and showcase of rhythms, so the most important thing for a tap dancer is rhythmicality, just as for musicians. Then in terms of performance, showmanship is important, as well as musicality, or the capacity to interpret and translate music into movement. When we think of tap dance there is a tendency to focus solely on the dance aspect, but actually, before being a dance, I think tap is a form of music since it relies fundamentally on creating rhythm. In this sense, rhythmicality and musicality are vital qualities for a tap dancer.Aya -Q- What advice would you give to someone who wants to be a professional tap dancer?Yono -A- To tap, tap a lot! I\u2019d tell them that rather than giving it a lot of thought, the most important thing is to put their tap shoes on and just tap. Explore and discover which rhythms come out of your practice each and every day. That\u2019s what practice is meant for: exploring, discovering, and developing a capacity to express oneself in new ways. If you do that over and over, at some point you\u2019ll find yourself a tap dancer!Aya \u2013 The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the performing arts. Due to physical distancing requirements and closure of the physical venues, curtailing not only public performances but also rehearsals, and live performances have been canceled or postponed.Q- How did you deal with and overcome this situation?Yono -A- The COVID-19 pandemic has created many difficulties not only for the artistic sector but for the economy, the social and medical sectors, every sphere of society has been affected. It\u2019s a difficult situation globally. But I think that, historically, artists have always played a special role, they have a sort of mission to inspire people in difficult times. Nowadays social distancing measures make it hard to meet each other in person, so artists have to create new ways to bring arts and culture to the public, such as through digital platforms.As KTO we also opted for online media to present our show and hosted livestream sessions to communicate with our audience in real-time. For classes too, we created a tutorial program on YouTube, NUGUNA Tap Dance, to help students continue nurturing their skills at home. This has also allowed us to reach and interact with more people, not only in Korea but abroad. For example, we received videos from 16 different countries on one of our Instagram challenges. Feeling connected brings us comfort as we try to overcome this situation together.Aya \u2013 Last month, you held an amazing concert called \u201cAll That RHYTHM\u201d.Q- Are there any other upcoming projects and performances?Yono -A- Yes, we presented our signature tap concert, \u2018All That RHYTHM\u2019 last October. It was the first time meeting a live audience since the pandemic started almost two years ago. Preparing a show while complying with all the necessary social distancing measures was challenging, but we were very happy with the chance to perform live.In the future, we hope to continue developing this show and creating new contents by collaborating with genres we haven\u2019t approached until now. We want to keep developing Korea Tap Orchestra\u2019s unique artistic color, creating our own style and rhythms to share with the global tap dance scene. As a tap dancer based in Korea, I\u2019d like to contribute to the growth and greater popularity of this genre by tapping into Korean music and arts, such as gugak and k-pop, which are the closest to us.Aya -Q- What\u2019s the first thing you want to do after the COVID-19 pandemic is over?Yono -A- I\u2019d like to organize a tap dance festival. An event where we can be reunited in the same space, finally take off our masks, dance, and enjoy the show together. Not only performing from afar but inviting the audience to join us on stage and interact, offer them a chance to experience tap dance in person and have a good time together.Aya -Q- What are your goals and dreams for the future?Yono -A- Maybe it\u2019s because I do it myself, but I think tap dance is very fun. I\u2019d like for many more people to get to know tap dance, which is partly why KTO strives to meet the public each year with \u2018All That RHYTHM\u2019. I\u2019d like to create chances for tap dance to be popularized so that more people can enjoy it. This could include movies, through idol groups that people love, CFs (advertisement clips), musicals\u2026I wish there were many more spaces and opportunities to showcase tap dance across all genres.Check out their amazing performances and you can enjoy more videos via the official YouTube channel \ud83d\udc47 The rhythm can be created through dancing, as tap dance; which is a performance art that relies on dancers creating catchy rhythms with their feet. Tap dance is known for its syncopated, catchy beats and improvisational choreography, which links it to jazz music.And you can find many dance studios that teach tap classes if you are interested in this type of dance and want to learn it. In this article, I will introduce to you a special interview with the professional tap dancer \u201cYono Lee\u201d CEO of YONO Company, Korea Tap Orchestra (KTO) Founder, Executive Director and Team Captain to tell us more about \u201cKTO\u201d, a professional tap dance group. One of the most prominent works of the group, \u201cYono\u201d was the lead tap dance choreographer for the movie \u2018Swing Kids\u2019 (\uc2a4\uc719\ud0a4\uc988) Starring EXO\u2019s Do Kyung-soo, they also choreographed for other films such as Yuwol, Bird Cage and delivered the opening show of the 2021 Bucheon International Fantastic Film Festival (BIFAN), as well as the commercials like Outback in collaboration with Lia Kim, Maxim T.O.P., and Mongbest. Voil\u00e0 The Dialogue: Aya \u2013Q- At first, can you tell us more about \u201cKorea Tap Orchestra\u201d and when the troupe was founded? Yono -A- Korea Tap Orchestra (KTO) is a professional tap dance team that brings together top-level tap dancers from various studios in Korea. The group was founded in 2016 under the label YONO Company, a tap dance-based performing arts, and arts education company. I am its founder and artistic director \u201cYong-kap Park\u201d. We launched our signature tap concert called \u2018All That RHYTHM\u2019 in 2016 and we\u2019ve been performing and reinventing this show annually since then. Originally, tap dance is an American dance and music genre, a performing art that developed on par with jazz. At KTO we aim to reinterpret this genre by infusing it with Korean sentiments and adapting it to Korean music and rhythms. We want to create our own content and that can resonate with our local audience. Aya -Q- What kind of music do you dance to? Yono -A- Tap dance developed in close connection with jazz, so tap dancers not only in America but around the world typically train and perform on jazz rhythms: this is the classic form of tap. Of course, this is a key part of our training and repertory, and we are grateful for the deep heritage we received from U.S. tap legends. But we also wanted to bring something new into the genre, so we began to experiment with traditional Korean rhythms of gugak. In this way, we try to bring a Korean perspective to the genre and innovate by fusing the classic aspects of this art form with our own cultural background. This is an ongoing research for us. Aya -Q- How many hours per day or week do you spend practicing? Yono -A- Typically, we practice twice a week as a team and three or more times a week individually, for about two or three hours at a time. This would be the basic structure for us.
