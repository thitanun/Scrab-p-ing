            "content": "EPEX recently came back with their 2nd EP \"BIPOLAR Pt. 2: Prelude of Love\" and the title track 'Do 4 Me'. During their comeback showcase, EPEX described 'Do 4 Me' as being a cute and loveable confession song that is as adorable as a cat. You can feel this as you watch the music video, too.\u00a0 In the lyrics of 'Do 4 Me' there is a line about wanting to be reborn as the cat of the person they like. The music video features a lot of cat motifs such as the members wearing cat paws and ears, watching cat videos, fur on the film set, and cat emoticons.\u00a0You can watch the full music video here. EPEX's Ayden especially looked adorable in the video, decked out like a cat and showing off his paws with a cute roar pose. It had us thinking about what kind of cat each EPEX member would be? Here is a list of the cats we think each member would be if they really were reborn as one. This list is in no particular order. \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws Maine Coons are known for being super affectionate and adorable, especially to the people they are close to. Ayden is definitely famous for being a cutie and any K-Pop fan would fall for him after seeing his personality. \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws Chartreux cats are known for being independent and cool but also silly and social. Wish has a cool charm to him especially as the leader of EPEX but he can also be clumsy. This cat definitely represents his duality. \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws American Shorthair cats are energetic and loving. Keum is known for his bright personality and energy. He perfectly fits the description of this adorable cat. Not to mention that they have a similarly piercing gaze. \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws Norwegian Forest cats are known for enjoying jumping around and being very sociable. After all, AMin is the main dancer of EPEX and is also known for his bright personality and speaking energetically as if he is chirping.\u00a0 \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws One of Mu's biggest charms is his piercing gaze and unforgettable appearance. Once you see him, his visuals and aura make you want to take a second look and keep staring at him. The Siamese cat breed is one of the breeds that many people know even if they are not a cat-lover because of their striking appearance, too.\u00a0 \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws Raggamuffin cats are known for their sweet personalities and beautiful appearance. Because of their big size they are also known as gentle giants. BaekSeung is indeed quite handsome with the mole under his eye adding to his charm. He is also the tallest member of EPEX.\u00a0 \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws Russian Blue cats are intelligent and loyal cats with a playful side. However, they are shy. YeWang once said that he is actually an introvert. However, when he is with his members you can see him open up and show his funny side. \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws Jeff's specialty in the group is aegyo that makes the other members want to take care of him. Bengal cats are known for being affectionate pets and quite chatty. Jeff definitely fits both of these descriptions. \u00a0 Are you a cat lover? What do you think of the EPEX members as cats? Let us know in the comments. \u00a0 EPEX Is Doing A Lot 4 Us With Their 2nd EP \"BIPOLAR Pt. 2: Prelude Of Love\" ComebackREVIEWS|Oct 27, 2021Kpopmap Fan Interview: A Filipino K-Pop Fan Talks About Her Favorite Groups & Bias From CIX & EPEXFAN INTERVIEW|Oct 18, 2021 EPEX Is Doing A Lot 4 Us With Their 2nd EP \"BIPOLAR Pt. 2: Prelude Of Love\" Comeback Kpopmap Fan Interview: A Filipino K-Pop Fan Talks About Her Favorite Groups & Bias From CIX & EPEX K-Pop idols always go above and beyond when they perform on stage.

The moment fans hit the play button, many were amazed and stunned by how gorgeous the sets of the music videos are. Thanks to the colourful themes and computer graphics, IZ*ONE definitely has captivated their fans. With that being said, some of their fans had also noticed something interesting about the necklace which maknae WonYoung was wearing. Stone Music Screenshot If you were to take a close look, the necklace which WonYoung was wearing reads the numbers '102'. The numbers if read in different languages can will have different sounds but it eventually will have the pronunciation of 'WonYoung'. Here is why! '1' in English is pronounced as one (won) and for '0', it is pronounced as 'Young' in Korean. As for '2', it is 'yi' in Korean. Combining all 3 of them, it will be 'WonYoung-yi' which is a cute version of calling her name. Idol Issue Fans who had noticed the necklace could not help but talked about how creative it was and loved the fact that WonYoung had kept it subtle yet meaningful. Currently, IZ*ONE is promoting their title track 'Secret story of a swan' on various music shows.

The reason why this group is drawing more and more attention as time passes is that their musical range and conceptual uniqueness are unlike anything we've seen before. In such a short span of their career, EPEX have already successfully experimented with a number of genres, working their way towards establishing a signature sound. It is rather rare for a rookie group to develop a sonic identity so early in their artistic journey, which makes EPEX that much more impressive.\u00a0 EPEX's first EP Album \"Bipolar Pt.1 Prelude of Anxiety\" features some strong and mature impressions with songs such as 'Go Big' with heavy EDM and trap influences and 'Lock Down' with a strong rap section as well as futuristic pop sounds, followed by an R&B and old school hip-hop genre shift with 'Cyanide', 'No Questions' and 'Sling Shot'. The vocal line and the rap line are so beautifully in sync that they blend into each other. Every member shines with their talent individually but even more so as a group. EPEX's focus is on positing themselves as a unit and it shows perfectly with this EP.\u00a0  The 2nd EP Album from EPEX, \"Bipolar Pt.2 Prelude of Love\" almost immediately gives off an air of playfulness and innocence that was absent in the debut EP, even though this release comes only months after the first part. Clearly, EPEX is eager to show what they're made of and this gradual disclosure is perfect to build anticipation for what they could have in store for us in the future.\u00a0 'Love Virus' is bright, energetic, and youthful, which inevitably makes it sound authentic and convincing. 'Do 4 Me' follows on the same line but with an added bounce and groove. Once you listen to this song, there's no way it is getting out of your head. The hook is truly addictive, reminiscent of the simple yet catchy tunes from children's rhymes.\u00a0  'Breathtaking' borrows from alt-rock influences but combines it with EPEX's own flavor, which makes the reworked genre perfectly suited to the members' vocal and rap tones. This right here is what we meant when we said EPEX has already created a signature sound. Truly, if this were to form the base of EPEX's musical identity, it wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that it is only a matter of time before EPEX take over the world.\u00a0 Finally, in a creatively genius move, the last song in the EP album, 'Traveller' hits us like a wave of nostalgia. The undercurrent of the marching band makes it motivational, touching, and in simple words, fantastic.

            "content": "If there is one new K-Pop group who lives up to the tag \"Super rookies\" then it has to be EPEX. Fierce, exciting, refreshing, bold, vibrant, and energetic. There are so many terms that could be associated with this group and all of them do their talents justice. The 8 member idol group made its official debut in 2021 and greatly impressed viewers with their breathtakingly fresh concepts, impeccable performances, stunning visuals, and mesmerizing vocals and rap talents. With the announcement of their upcoming 3rd EP album \"Prelude of Anxiety Chapter 1. 21st Century Boys'' which is set for release on the 11th of April 2022, here are some of the reasons why we are looking forward to this comeback. \u00a0   EPEX's originality stems from their concepts and ideas. Their twist on themes, their creative spin on various popular styles is part of what makes them interesting. With music video like 'Lock Down' we expect the quintessential dark theme that is common with many K-Pop groups, but with EPEX, there is also an element of artistry that flows with their concept. The stills, transitions, animations, and effects, these are not just random influx set to make the music video fun or interesting, they are key references to the lyrics and meaning of their song. And the same play out with the bright and cheery pop song 'Do 4 Me'. Beyond just the entertainment, fans can draw memorable meanings and references to their songs from their concepts. \u00a0    A new comeback means fresh performances filled with breathtaking dance moves that will surely thrill fans. With their previous stages, we have seen the idol group display a level of professionalism and skill set that is beyond their current status as rookies. Precise, clean, intense, yet made to look so effortless and easy, along with fans, with each stage performance, we are wowed by how much better they keep getting. And with this new come, we expect jaw-dropping moments as they display their impressive growth as performers. \u00a0   While their title tracks are certified bops, their b-side songs also fall well within this category. Their ability to skid on any style of music is truly amazing. From their first ep album \"Bipolar Pt.1 Prelude of Anxiety\" with songs like 'Go Big' and 'Lock Down' we see a style influenced by hip hop and R&B and with 'Cyanide' a bit of Latin sound. Also with 'No Questions', listeners are treated to a mix of trap and dance. This same versatility can be found in their second ep album \"Bipolar Pt.2 Prelude of Love\". With sounds that are made to reference the concept and message of their album names, there is a sense of artistry that they possess that invariably makes them stand out as super rookies. Check out the prelude of their new album below.  Are you excited about their new comeback?

            "content": "\u201cQueendom 2\u201d is the highly-anticipated second season of \u201cQueendom,\u201d one of Mnet\u2019s many survival shows. The show centers on 6 different K-Pop female acts performing against one another every week, with all groups releasing a new single by the end of the competition to see which single reaches the most success on the music charts. The first season featured lauded acts like Park Bom, AOA, MAMAMOO, Lovelyz, OH MY GIRL, and (G)I-DLE as contestants. After Mnet announced an upcoming second season of the show set to be hosted by Girls\u2019 Generation\u2019s TaeYeon, many fans began to discuss which groups they wanted to see featured on a second season of \u201cQueendom\u201d until Mnet officially announced the six female K-Pop artists set to compete in the show.\u00a0Kpopmap opened a vote on Feb. 25 asking fans which groups they were highly anticipated, don't miss to check out the results here. With the start of \"Queendom 2\" coming soon on Mar. 31,\u00a0Kpopmap has compiled a list of dazzling choreographies by these six artists in anticipation of the show\u2019s release. These choreographies prove these female artists are dancing queens and can execute choreographies with precision and power. Hopefully, we can also see them perform these songs and choreographies on the show. \u00a0 \u00a0 After their 2017 song \u2018Rollin'\u2019 went viral on the internet and rose on the music charts, Brave Girls are continuing to rise as a formidable girl group in the K-Pop industry. \u2018We Ride\u2019 is the group\u2019s latest comeback and the song\u2019s choreography perfectly reflects the mellow and groovy vibe of the city-pop inspired track. The choreography has simple movements but is riveting because of the girls\u2019 execution. This choreo is a good choice for anyone looking to learn more K-Pop choreographies. \u00a0 \u00a0 Rookie group VIVIZ members EunHa, SinB, and UmJi are no strangers to spectacular choreography. Formerly part of GFRIEND, a group commended for their complex dances, the girls re-debuting together with \u2018BOP BOP!\u2019 shows off their dancing abilities and stage presence. The inclusion of backup dancers is able to create unique formations and the overall playfulness of the choreography is able to highlight the girls individually and as a whole unit. This is certainly a debut choreography nobody will ever forget! \u00a0 \u00a0 WJSN (also known as Cosmic Girls), is a girl group adored by K-Pop fans domestically and internationally. One of the group\u2019s earliest releases, \u2018Secret\u2019 employs the \u201ccosmic\u201d concept that would become the group\u2019s signature image. Not only is the song itself very catchy, the choreography is a marvel to watch. Having all thirteen members create lines and form unique formations allows the choreography to feel regal and grander. If we had to choose, the choreography for the chorus where the members are moving their arms with grace is arguably the best part of the whole dance. WJSN continues to have detailed and energetic dances but \u2018Secret\u2019 will always have a special place in fans\u2019 hearts for its choreography. \u00a0 \u00a0 LOONA has become a global sensation frequently recognized for their synchronization and stage presence while dancing and \u2018Butterfly\u2019 is no exception. The choreography utilizes everything great about LOONA\u2019s choreographies. The synchronization is out of this world and LOONA uses the number of members the best here to create never-before-seen formations. Let\u2019s not forget the ripples and risky choreography they pull off at this section. Moreso, the group uses their hands and arms to resemble the butterfly motif present in the song. Ultimately, the elegant and majestic choreography of LOONA\u2019s \u201cButterfly\u201d perfectly represents the free-spirited and elegant nature of a butterfly. \u00a0 \u00a0 Formed on the hit Mnet survival show \u201cGIRLS PLANET 999,\u201d Kep1er is already making their mark as a powerhouse rookie group. While nobody can forget the iconic dance for \u2018WA DA DA,\u2019 it\u2019s their B-side release \u2018MVSK\u2019 where the group shows their ability to pull off a mature concept. Choreographed by Kang EunJoo and \u201cGIRLS PLANET 999\u201d dance mentors Jang JuHee and Mihawk Back, the B-side\u2019s intricate choreography utilizes more mature and sleek dance moves. The ripples and formations require so much precision and timing (the dance break at the 2:10 timestamp is a highlight). Fortunately, the nine members of Kep1er are able to flawlessly execute this concept and choreography. \u00a0 \u00a0 Seen by many as one of the best K-Pop female dancers and vocalists, Former SISTAR member HyoLyn\u2019s solo releases have always shown off the superstar\u2019s charms and performance skills. The choreography for her song \u2018Layin Low\u2019 exudes the confidence and sexy concept HyoLyn is known for, embodying a lot of sensual movements and floor work. The fact she looks effortless dancing while wearing high heels is a feat of its own. While HyoLyn will be the only soloist competing in the season, she still will be a force to be reckoned with. \u00a0 These Are The Most Highly Anticipated Artists On \"Queendom 2\", According To Kpopmap ReadersK-POP STORIES|Mar 4, 2022Here Are The 6 Female K-Pop Artists Who Will Officially Be Competing In \"Queendom 2\"K-POP STORIES|Feb 21, 202210 K-Pop Girl Groups We Would Love To See On \"Queendom 2\"K-POP STORIES|Feb 8, 2022 These Are The Most Highly Anticipated Artists On \"Queendom 2\", According To Kpopmap Readers Here Are The 6 Female K-Pop Artists Who Will Officially Be Competing In \"Queendom 2\" 10 K-Pop Girl Groups We Would Love To See On \"Queendom 2\" "

A year later a saw an Instagram post of C9 Ent. that they'll gonna have a new group! I was so happy that he'll finally debut and of course, I supported them with my whole heart!!! \u2764\u2764\u2764 C9 Entertainment \u00a0 What are the reasons why you love your favorite group? CIX and EPEX are so hard working. They love their fans so much, and they are like my stress relievers that can make me proud, can make me laugh, and cry at the same time. \ud83d\ude0a\ud83d\ude0a \u00a0 Who caught your attention at first and why? In CIX, it's HyunSuk, he's so tall, but he's the maknae. I also love his voice so much when he sings or raps. In EPEX, it's BaekSeung, when I first saw him his hair was still black, and after I watched their first video as C9 rookies for the first time, the only one I could remember was him \ud83d\ude02. I remembered how tall he is, how charismatic, and how cute he was. CIX Twitter C9 Entertainment CIX Twitter C9 Entertainment \u00a0 Who is your bias, and why? In CIX it's BX! I love his rap and I love the way how he leads and takes care of his donsaengs >-<. He's such a cute, hardworking, and cool leader \ud83d\udc4d. In EPEX it's BaekSeung! As I said, he's so cute and tall, and when I first heard him rap in the show \"CapTeen\", I was amazed! I like his voice and the stability of rapping. He also took his first challenge in acting and he did a great job which made me love him more as my bias!  EPEX Twitter \u00a0 Can you recommend a title track and a B-side track for new fans? For FIXs I would choose 'Movie Star'! It's their debut song and one of their best songs! For the B-side, it's 'Here for you'. Its message is that CIX will be always here for FIXs, even when you're new to the fandom, once you've joined us we will never leave each other!   \u00a0 Can you recommend a fancam, V-live, cover video, cover dance, or individual content video of your bias to our readers? For CIX's BX, I would recommend his 'Text Me' vocal cover, there you can not only see his vocals but also his rap! For EPEX's BaekSeung, it's his 'Rhythm Ta' performance in \"CapTeen\"!   \u00a0 Can you also do the same type of recommendation for the group? For new FIXs, I would recommend 'Hello CIX', and for Zeniths, 'Welcome 2 House' \u2764.   \u00a0 Can you share with us one of your favorite lyrics? It's CIX's 'Here for you' lyrics where it goes \"And then should a time come when you're in despair, Close your eyes, picture that I'm there, Two is better than being one, My love for you will never come undone\". These lyrics always comfort me and always tells me that there is someone that will be always here for me. \u00a0 Do you feel there are any misunderstandings, things that are not well known, or any prejudices about your favorite group from other fans (non-fans)? There's one thing, it's about EPEX, first of all, Ayden is not Canadian! Please remember that. But yes, he's good at English \ud83d\ude0e (Jokingly saying \ud83d\ude1a). EPEX Twitter \u00a0 Here is a special message for BaekSeung from Janessa. For BaekSeungSeungieee you did really good in your drama! Considering that it was your first drama, you showed good expressions and did your best. This is just EPEX's and your start so we Zeniths and of course you guys EPEX will always work hard! WE LOVE YOU <333 C9 Entertainment Thank you for answering our questions, Janessa! \u00a0 If you are interested in joining Kpopmap Fan Interview Project, please get in touch with us at [email\u00a0protected] A post shared by Kpopmap (@kpopmapofficial)  \u00a0 Kpopmap Fan Interview: A Filipino K-Pop Fan Talks About His Favorite Groups & Bias From SuperM, EXO, SHINee, NCT 127 and WayV "

Starship Entertainment The point choreography of 'ELEVEN' can be identified as two dances. The first is the 'heaven' dance. This dance is when they reach up into the sky and bring their hands down to their mouth. Starship Entertainment The second point dance is called the 'seven' dance. They do a number of steps leading to a count up from 1 to 7, then make a 7 symbol with their hands.\u00a0 Starship Entertainment The members shared some cute memories about filming their first-ever music video together, including how they huddled up like penguins to share warmth as it was getting colder.

Starship Entertainment You can watch the music video for 'ELEVEN' here.  After their performance, the IVE members sat down again for some question and answer time.

            "content": "EPEX recently came back with their 2nd EP \"BIPOLAR Pt. 2: Prelude of Love\" and the title track 'Do 4 Me'. During their comeback showcase, EPEX described 'Do 4 Me' as being a cute and loveable confession song that is as adorable as a cat. You can feel this as you watch the music video, too.\u00a0 In the lyrics of 'Do 4 Me' there is a line about wanting to be reborn as the cat of the person they like. The music video features a lot of cat motifs such as the members wearing cat paws and ears, watching cat videos, fur on the film set, and cat emoticons.\u00a0You can watch the full music video here. EPEX's Ayden especially looked adorable in the video, decked out like a cat and showing off his paws with a cute roar pose. It had us thinking about what kind of cat each EPEX member would be? Here is a list of the cats we think each member would be if they really were reborn as one. This list is in no particular order. \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws Maine Coons are known for being super affectionate and adorable, especially to the people they are close to. Ayden is definitely famous for being a cutie and any K-Pop fan would fall for him after seeing his personality. \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws Chartreux cats are known for being independent and cool but also silly and social. Wish has a cool charm to him especially as the leader of EPEX but he can also be clumsy. This cat definitely represents his duality. \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws American Shorthair cats are energetic and loving. Keum is known for his bright personality and energy. He perfectly fits the description of this adorable cat. Not to mention that they have a similarly piercing gaze. \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws Norwegian Forest cats are known for enjoying jumping around and being very sociable. After all, AMin is the main dancer of EPEX and is also known for his bright personality and speaking energetically as if he is chirping.\u00a0 \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws One of Mu's biggest charms is his piercing gaze and unforgettable appearance. Once you see him, his visuals and aura make you want to take a second look and keep staring at him. The Siamese cat breed is one of the breeds that many people know even if they are not a cat-lover because of their striking appearance, too.\u00a0 \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws Raggamuffin cats are known for their sweet personalities and beautiful appearance. Because of their big size they are also known as gentle giants. BaekSeung is indeed quite handsome with the mole under his eye adding to his charm. He is also the tallest member of EPEX.\u00a0 \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws Russian Blue cats are intelligent and loyal cats with a playful side. However, they are shy. YeWang once said that he is actually an introvert. However, when he is with his members you can see him open up and show his funny side. \u00a0 C9 Entertainment / Daily Paws Jeff's specialty in the group is aegyo that makes the other members want to take care of him. Bengal cats are known for being affectionate pets and quite chatty. Jeff definitely fits both of these descriptions. \u00a0 Are you a cat lover? What do you think of the EPEX members as cats?

            "content": "By now, you might have already noticed that the outfits and clothes which K-Pop idols wear on stage is not something that everyone can pull off. Most of the time, they have sequins, glitter or are even design in a way especially for stage purposes. On an online community, netizens have been sharing some of the glamorous outfits that female K-Pop idols have been wearing. They commented that because they are idols and also because they are wearing them to perform on stage, these outfits look amazing and beautiful. Let's take a look at them! \u00a0 #1 BLACKPINK's Jennie Paint It Black Back when Jennie was promoting her solo single 'SOLO', fans and netizens were amazed by the outfit which she was styled in. From sexy off-shoulder to white top and corset, Jennie was praised by many for being able to pull off different styling each time. \u00a0 #2 ChungHa dear, moon ChungHa is definitely a glamorous queen as for her past few promotions, fans noticed how she was being styled in shimmery outfits. To add on, many also noticed how the accessories that she had worn also gave extra points to the image which she was trying to give off. \u00a0 #3 TWICE's NaYeon Heartflipped When it comes to girl groups, one of the first few of them which many can think of is most probably TWICE. They are known for their catchy song and choreography. When it comes to outfits, it seems like TWICE has it on another level. Member NaYeon was mentioned sometime before for her glamarous fit with this particular outfit, pointing out how it had allowed her visuals to be emphasized even more. \u00a0 #4 Red Velvet's Joy Nate Pann Remember back when Red Velvet was promoting 'Peek-A-Boo', member Joy had gained a lot of attention from the public. They mentioned that she is capable of making a simple outfit look amazing and how it also added a different essence of class too. \u00a0 #5 IZ*ONE's WonYoung Upper East Side Compared to other K-Pop idols' outfits, the one which WonYoung was wearing might not appeared to be as shimmery or super fantastic. However, the sailor concept as well as the fresh, youthful vibes are also something not everyone can pull off too.

            "content": "Another month has gone by and K-Pop idols are continuing to be the trend-setters and icons of today\u2019s fashion world. Global fashion houses and luxury brands are still pushing K-Pop idols to the forefront of their marketing brand ambassadors and we could not be any happier. This month was an especially special time for fashion, with the bulk of Paris Fashion Week taking place in the first few days of March. K-Pop idols made up a good portion of the guests invited to these exclusive fashion shows. Idols took to social media to share the designer outfits and pieces they wore either for magazine covers or new campaigns. Do you know what this means? Once again, Kpopmap will be highlighting some of our favourite high-fashion looks we saw on K-Pop idols this month. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A post shared by ROSE\u0301 (@roses_are_rosie)  We\u2019re starting off with the lovely Ros\u00e9 from megastar group BLACKPINK. Ros\u00e9 is a fashion powerhouse, being the global ambassador for both Yves Saint Laurent and jewelry brand Tiffany and Co. For March, BLACKPINK fans were in awe after seeing Ros\u00e9 on the cover for DAZED Korea\u2019s March Issue. She is glammed to the max in Yves Saint Laurent pieces. The looks themself range from old-Hollywood glamour to modern model off duty. For the magazine, she discussed her new budding friendship with YSL\u2019s Creative Director Anthony Vaccarello. Spoiler alert: Ros\u00e9 will not be the only BLACKPINK member appearing on this list as the entire group wore some stellar high-fashion looks this month. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A post shared by WINWIN (@wwiinn_7)  Pink has now become the unofficial \u201cofficial\u201d colour of the year, thanks to the Valentino Autumn/Winter 2022 show. Pierpaolo Piccioli\u2019s show demanded audiences be immersed in the \u2018Valentino Pink PP\u2019 hue he developed with Pantone for the show. Attending the event in Shanghai intended to live stream the runway show happening in Paris, NCT\u2019s WinWin is wearing this black-and-white ensemble. The Valentino \u2018Waves\u2019 print long-sleeve shirt is the statement piece of WinWin\u2019s look and it's paired alongside simple black dress pants. WinWin has been killing it with his latest endeavours in fashion and this classic but elevated Valentino look is no exception. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A post shared by JISOO\ud83e\udd0d (@sooyaaa__)  Throughout all of March, BLACKPINK\u2019s JiSoo wore an array of Dior looks for Paris Fashion Week and on the cover of Harper\u2019s Bazaar Japan and Vogue Korea. While it\u2019s hard to pick a favourite look, the one she wore to the Dior Autumn/Winter 2022 show was one of the highlights of Paris Fashion Week. The singer/actress attending the show was a given since she\u2019s currently the brand\u2019s global ambassador. She donned a Dior yellow plaid dress with a white blouse, black tie and heels and the Lady Dior handbag. The look feels like a callback to the dress Cher Horowitz wore in the classic 90s hit film \"Clueless\" in the best way possible. This look is also extremely relevant with the rising popularity of black ties as an accessory and the preppy aesthetic as a whole. No matter what outfit she is wearing, JiSoo emanates the aura of a goddess. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A post shared by \u1109\u116e\u11bd\u110b\u1175 \ud83d\udc84\ud83d\udc85\ud83d\udc61\ud83d\udc60\ud83c\udf80\ud83d\udc59\ud83c\udf02\ud83d\udc57\ud83c\udf02\ud83c\udf80\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc8c (@skuukzky)  Like JiSoo, Suzy is another beloved visual in K-Pop and actress rocking looks from Dior. Suzy teased on her Instagram her cover for the April 2022 issue of Marie Claire Korea in collaboration with Dior\u2019s Spring/Summer 2022 collection. The photoshoot shows Suzy in a plethora of preppy and retro apparel and accessories from the luxury brand. While the clothes are beautiful, the real surprise is Suzy\u2019s baby bangs, a hairstyle she has rarely worn. Suzy always knows how to make a statement with her fashion and rightfully deserves her title of the \u201cNation\u2019s Crush.\u201d \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A post shared by \uc548\uc720\uc9c4 AN YUJIN (@_yujin_an)  Former IZ*ONE and current IVE member YuJin has always been praised for her visuals and talent. Now, she\u2019s gracing our screens as one of the faces of Versace\u2019s new Spring/Summer 2022 campaign. The post on her personal Instagram shows the idol wearing a bunch of pieces from the brand, such as a black minidress and a monogrammed halter top. To top it all off, she\u2019s holding a Versace purse in almost every picture. At the end of the Instagram post is the promotional video of YuJin strutting around the grey and black set in all of her looks. YuJin showcases her fierce visuals and modelling abilities in this video and this is hopefully the start of a modelling career for the young star. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A post shared by LISA (@lalalalisa_m)  The third BLACKPINK member making an appearance on this list, Lisa is no stranger to collaborating with brands like CELINE and Chivas. During Paris Fashion Week, Lisa took to Instagram to share her day while exploring the \u2018city of love.\u2019 Rocking loose black pants and a long-sleeve tee, Lisa\u2019s style tends to lean more towards a casual and street style aesthetic. What we all could not help but notice was the rectangular black handbag she had around her shoulder with \u201cCELINE\u201d in bold lettering. That is in fact the \"Matelass\u00e9 Monochrome\", one of the newest handbags from the brand that is slated to be released sometime later this year. Lisa has both stunned us with her beauty and made us all wonder if we\u2019ll someday ever be rich enough to afford designer handbags. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A post shared by Mark Tuan (@marktuan)  GOT7\u2019s Mark Tuan has stayed busy this year, working on his upcoming solo projects. He also, like many of the previously mention idols, was invited to attend events for Paris Fashion Week. In the gorgeous capital of France, Mark attended the YSL Fall/Winter 2022 show by Anthony Vaccarello in a mature and rugged look. Mark is wearing leather pants, a patterned blazer, and a burgundy shirt with most of the buttons undone - all pieces from YSL\u2019s Spring/Summer 22 collection. On his Instagram post, Mark shared clips from the actual show itself, where the models walked right near the Eiffel Tower. Fashion-forward idols like Mark sharing their experience attending high-fashion shows is so gratifying for fans to see. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A post shared by TaeYeon (@taeyeon_ss)  Girls\u2019 Generation\u2019s TaeYeon is one of the most respected and recognizable idols in the industry. From being the leader of the \u201cNation\u2019s Girl Group\u201d, an active solo artist and the upcoming MC for \u201c Queendom 2\u201d, she\u2019s done it all in her career. It\u2019s completely fitting for someone of her status to be seen with designer items. In March, the \u2018INVU\u2019 singer posted to Instagram her holding and wearing the black \u201cMoonlight\u201d ankle boots from Louis Vuitton. The boots are on full display as she casually models them in these laid-back photos. With her stunning visuals, TaeYeon looks like a Louis Vuitton model ready to stomp on the runway in these boots. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A post shared by \uc7a5\uc6d0\uc601 WONYOUNG (@for_everyoung10)  Another former IZ*ONE and current IVE member appearing on this list, WonYoung was recently chosen as one of the Korean celebrities to represent the Italian fashion brand, Miu Miu. Headed by Miuccia Prada, Miu Miu has always been a relatively popular brand but attention skyrocketed after the micro-mini skirt and cropped sweater look went viral - as we saw last month on Girls\u2019 Generation\u2019s YoonA. WonYoung being chosen as a model fits in line with the feminine and youthful aesthetic of the brand and she\u2019s been wearing outfits exclusively by the brand this month. While WonYoung did wear the aforementioned cropper sweater, let\u2019s bring our attention to this all-black beaded two-piece set from the Miu Miu Fall/Winter 2022 collection. With a Miu Miu purse in hand, WonYoung is embodying a rich and luxurious princess in this outfit. It\u2019s no doubt WonYoung is making a name for herself as a talented performer and fashionista of the 4th Gen. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 A post shared by J (@jennierubyjane)  Rounding out the list, are we honestly surprised BLACKPINK\u2019s Jennie is making an appearance here? She is the ultimate definition of an \u201cit-girl\u201d in the K-Pop and high fashion world. At the Chanel Womenswear Fall/Winter 2022 show, Jennie made headlines for her stunning monochrome look from Chanel Creative Director Virginie Viard\u2019s collection. We all know Jennie is the global ambassador for the brand so it was inevitable she\u2019d be in full-Chanel for Paris Fashion Week. For the show, she wore a black puffer coat, a tweed bustier, shorts, white lace socks, and platform sandals. The gold accessories and a micro-Chanel purse accompanying the look are the cherries on top. Jennie captures the feminine and elegant vibe of Chanel in this ensemble, which proves why she is the perfect global ambassador for the brand. There is only one thing in the world we can all be certain about - Jennie will always bring sophisticated and elevated looks no matter where she goes. \u00a0 Are there any other idols sporting high-fashion clothing that you loved in March?

WonYoung has often been complimented for her amazing golden ratio. She's extremely tall for her age, and WonYoung herself has expressed concern stating that she wants to stop growing.

            "content": "Blue hair has been seen more frequently in the K-Pop scene not too long ago. The biggest stars in the industry have been seen changing their hair color to ash blue and similar tones and if you've been wondering why so many of them have been doing so, the likely reason is, it was the color of 2020. So blue being the color of the year, it's a good thing that K-Pop celebrities represented the color really well. KBS Twitter You can check out some of the idols below. \u00a0 Hong JinYoung Trot singer Hong JinYoung just doesn't seem to age. She pulled off the ash blue hair color effortlessly. Twitter WheeIn (MAMAMOO) WheeIn is an absolute mermaid goddess with this particular hair color.

            "content": "Have you noticed how a person can look completely different with and without glasses? Wearing glasses does not mean that you are not attractive but in certain occasions, different frames of glasses give a different kind of image. Some people are able to show off their beautiful facial features after removing it. Most of the time K-Pop fans love to see their favourite K-Pop idols' pre-debut pictures as they could tell how much they glowed up. Some of them used to wear glasses and still do now! Netizens recently took note of 5 female K-Pop idols who used to wear glasses in elementary school and let's find out who they are! \u00a0 1. (G)I-DLE's MiYeon Idol Issue Not long ago, the graduation photos of MiYeon had surfaced online and fans could only shared that she looked really different and adorable when she was younger! (G)I-DLE Official Twitter \u00a0 2. IZ*ONE's YuJin Idol Issue YuJin from IZ*ONE is another idol who looked really adorable with glasses when she was still in elementary school. However, did you ever imagine that she would transform into such a beautiful young lady? IZ*ONE Official Instagram \u00a0 3. IZ*ONE's HyeWon Idol Issue Did you also know that HyeWon used to wear glasses too?

STAYC's Yoon Idol Issue Glasses also cannot hide the beauty of Yoon!

WJSN's Luda Idol Issue Who knew that wearing glasses make such drastic changes to a person's image? There is no way to argue how gorgeous Luda is without her glasses!

            "title": "8 K-Drama Genres We Think Would Suit The EPEX Members",
            "content": "Every year, there are a number of incredible rookie artists who debut with huge potential and big dreams. Within a short period of time, they're able to show the world what they're made of, leaving fans anticipating more. One such group that debuted in 2021 is EPEX. With a unique sonic aesthetic, this 8-member group has already established their name in the industry, earning their first MAMA nomination in the category of \"Best New Male Artist\".\u00a0 In recent years, it has been quite common for K-Pop idols to transition into acting quite early on in their careers. We cannot help but wonder what the EPEX members would be like if they were to debut as actors. Here are 8 K-Drama genres we think would fit the 8 EPEX members perfectly! \u00a0 EPEX's Twitter Wish's charming and protective nature would be perfect for a campus mystery drama. He would make for an amazing student detective as he unravels the mysteries that lurk behind a prestigious private school. Something like \"The School Nurse Files\" or\u00a0 \"The Great Shaman Ga DooShim\" would be ideal for Wish's drama debut. \u00a0 EPEX's Twitter There's a dreamlike quality to Keum that is hard to miss. Even though he has already debuted as an actor (he was in \"Best Mistake 2\" and will be appearing in \"Best Mistake 3\"), a drama that holds the magic of young minds with big dreams is perfect for Keum, especially if it is related to music or any other art. As it is still a sentiment that is rich in Keum, he would be able to fulfill a similar character better than anyone else. \u00a0 EPEX's Twitter Mu's puppy-like personality would be perfectly suited to a noona romance. An upper-class senior student, a friend's older sister, the possibilities are endless. Such a story would be pure and innocent but still exciting and entertaining. Even though Mu might seem reserved, he has a fire inside him: a characteristic that makes us believe that he would be able to woo his noona with ease. \u00a0 EPEX's Twitter AMin has such a soothing and adorable personality that we would love to see him every day of the week in a long-form family drama. Something like \"High Kick!\" or \"My Father is Strange\" would be perfect for highlighting AMin's strengths. With Korean sitcoms on the rise once again and global OTT platforms taking them on, it doesn't sound too far-fetched at all! \u00a0 EPEX's Twitter BaekSeung has already appeared in a cameo role in \"Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha\" as a member of the fictional boy group DOS but it probably cannot be considered his drama debut. With his towering physique and extraordinary visuals, we'd love to see him debut in a historical drama! \u00a0 EPEX's Twitter Ayden is knowledgeable, curious, and brilliant. He is also known as the brain of the team! Doesn't that remind you of the hacker in any heist drama/film? An action-thriller or heist drama would be perfect for Ayden's drama debut. We can totally imagine him coding away and getting into super-secret databases, leading the team to a seamless victory. \u00a0 EPEX's Twitter YeWang seems like he would be the kind of actor who would perfectly pull of the role of the ideal tsundere in a campus romance. His striking visuals would make all the students either want to be with him or be him but he would have eyes only on the one special transfer student who is different from everyone else. \u00a0 EPEX's Twitter If there's one EPEX member we'd like to see in a supernatural drama, it is Jeff. His mysterious eyes and contemplative nature would make him an amazing gumiho. Besides, when his tender-hearted and soft side is revealed, we're sure viewers will fall even more in love with him. \u00a0 Which EPEX member would you like to see in a K-Drama?

If you had already noticed, some idols made use of several platforms such as V-Live or YouTube to communicate with fans. One interesting content that Kpopmap had noticed was planting or farming! Different idols from different groups were seen planting edibles either on the rooftop of their company or at home. Let's take a look below! \u00a0 1. NCT's TaeYong and SungChan  Making use of the space available on the rooftop of SM Entertainment, TaeYong and SungChan planted many different kinds of fruits and plants together. They look adorable while wearing a sun hat and many fans love how they also enjoyed snacks after planting them. \u00a0 2. TXT's Huening Kai, SooBin, and YeonJun  The adorable trio of TXT spent their time with fans through V-Live when they had decided to plant some tomatoes! They were goofy, lifting up the atmosphere of the V-Live session. Many fans commented that they looked like they were more interested in making the delicious snacks than actually planting the tomatoes. \u00a0 3. SF9's JaeYoon  JaeYoon is such a sweet and adorable person and we can tell just by how careful he was when planting the plants into the pots. Aside from this V-Live session, JaeYoon also constantly updates fans about his plants. \u00a0 4. SHINee's Key  Did you know that Key had appeared on MBC \"I Live Alone\"?

All the characters of the drama have their own unique charms that make for the lovely atmosphere of the drama. With each episode, we are more and more inclined to \"Cha-Cha\" our way to the fictional town of Gongjin.\u00a0 tvN Recently two characters have been drawing particular attention for their charismatic visuals in \"Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha\". These are none other than the members of DOS, the fictional K-Pop group that Shin MinA's character Yoon HyeJin and Kim MinSeo's character Oh JooRi are seen fangirling over, much to the dismay of Hong DuShik (played by Kim SeonHo).\u00a0 tvN Previously, we told you about the handsome \"June\" from \"Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha\" (left). Today, we'll tell you about InWoo, the vocalist of DOS (right).\u00a0 InWoo is played by BaekSeung, who is also a real-life idol! He is a member of the boy group EPEX who debuted very recently in June of 2021.\u00a0 C9 Entertainment BaekSeung's real name is Kim HyunWoo. He was born on October 5, 2004, which makes him 16 years old. He is 186.2 cm tall, giving him a towering figure that is hard to miss. His MBTI type is ENFP. Even though he is the main vocalist of the group DOS, in his real group EPEX, he is the main rapper.\u00a0 MBC M As EPEX debuted during the pandemic, BaekSeung never had the chance to perform in front of a live audience. As such, his experience in \"Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha\" was his first time performing in front of a cheering crowd. He recently posted on Instagram about this experience as well. A post shared by EPEX \uc774\ud399\uc2a4 \ud32c\ud398\uc774\uc9c0 (@official_epex)  It was lovely to see BaekSeung in \"Hometown Cha-Cha-Cha\". We hope to see him soon in another drama once again!

According to 16personalities.com, A Mediator (INFP) is someone who possesses the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These rare personality types tend to be quiet, open-minded, and imaginative, and they apply a caring and creative approach to everything they do. \u00a0 Although they may seem quiet or unassuming, Mediators (INFPs) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity \u2013 Mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them. \u00a0 Idealistic and empathetic, Mediators long for deep, soulful relationships, and they feel called to help others. But because this personality type makes up such a small portion of the population, Mediators may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn\u2019t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique.

With their debut on the way, new fans are bound to be curious about what this group is about. Here are 4 things you should know about the new boy group LUMINOUS. \u00a0 YoungBin YoungBin is the leader of the group. He is also the lead vocal and a dancer. He was born on Oct. 5, 1998.\u00a0 WIP Company SuIl SuIl is a sub-vocal, rapper, and dancer. He was born on Mar. 30, 1999.\u00a0 WIP Company Steven Steven is a sub-vocal, rapper, and dancer.\u00a0 He was born on Jan. 17, 2001.\u00a0 WIP Company WooBin WooBin is the main vocal and a dancer. He was born on Apr. 1, 2000.\u00a0 WIP Company \u00a0 The group was initially under DS Entertainment and known as DS BOYS. Unfortunately, they couldn't release their first album and due to issues with their company, they left the company without debuting. Under WIP Company, however, they have even released a pre-debut EP called \"Luminous Dreaming\". The EP has a self-composed song by each member, proving that they are already multi-talented. \u00a0 The woman who is responsible for some of your favorite K-Pop artists' vocals is behind this new boy group. Kim SungEun is the CEO of WIP Company and has vocal trained K-Pop sensations BTS and TWICE. She has also appeared as a judge and coach on programs like \"PRODUCE X 101\". She wants to use her knowledge in collaboration with her company staff to create a monster rookie idol group.\u00a0 \u00a0 Each member has a symbol that they are associated with. Although we are unsure how it ties into their concept, it definitely means that they are a detail-oriented group and that their concepts will not fail to deliver. YoungBin's symbol is called 'highlight' and refers to the brightest light that can successfully lead the other members. WIP Company SuIl's symbol is a 'flash' that embodies twinkling radiance. It is supposed to represent his attention-grabbing light, which we assume means that he has quite a powerful stage presence. WIP Company Steven's symbol is a 'flare' which is a light that has the highest temperature. He represents the light of passion. By the sounds of it, he must have a huge dedication to performing and doing it well. WIP Company WooBin's symbol is 'mysterious moonlight' which embodies a light that moves emotions. It sounds like WooBin is good at eliciting emotions from his fans and his audience when he performs. WIP Company LUMINOUS released a symbol story film to tease their debut. You can see the elements of their symbols in motion. What do you think each of their symbols means? You can watch their symbol story here.  Judging by the things we've learned about LUMINOUS, fans can definitely look forward to their well-thought-out and capable debut.\u00a0 What do you think of this new boy group?

But with an average of at least 100 groups debuting every year, it\u2019s undoubtedly difficult to keep track of everyone.\u00a0 It takes a lot to discern which freshly debuted idols are worth keeping tabs on. There are many who remain criminally underrated despite their abilities, which is what we hope to remedy today. Here are six female rookies you might want to be on the lookout for. \u00a0  Previously a competitor in the reality television show \u201cK-Pop Star 4,\u201d Lily went on to be signed to JYP Entertainment where she trained for a whopping six and a half years before debuting in NMIXX. Since her days on the show, she\u2019s been known for her clear and full-bodied vocals, which many fans have said is refreshing to see among JYPE artists. Her qualifying video shows off her playful demeanor and stable voice. \u00a0  Prior to debuting, Riina was actually in \u201cProduce 48\u201d! She would go on to train for two years and five months before becoming a part of H1-KEY. Back when she was a \u201cProduce\u201d contender, she was often praised for her girl crush vibes which are still obvious to this day. Her fancam for their debut song is evidence of her impactful dance skills made all the more dynamic with her resonant singing ability.\u00a0 \u00a0  During the finale of the survival show \u201cGirl\u2019s Planet 999,\u201d YoungEun placed fifth after a worldwide audience vote. Her secured spot in the debut group Kep1er is assuredly one she earned on her own merit. It\u2019s easier to see for yourself\u2014like how her \u2018WA DA DA\u2019 fancam highlights her alluring charisma and powerful dance moves. YoungEun has a deadly stage presence that makes her fitting to be considered one of the group\u2019s aces!\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0  Don\u2019t be deceived by SeonYou\u2019s age or her youthful appearance. The moment she steps on the stage, she transforms into an entirely new persona who commands the audiences\u2019 attention. There\u2019s a reason why she was considered a force to be reckoned with while she was on the survival show \u201cMy Teenage Girl.\u201d In her \u2018Surprise\u2019 fancam, you can witness her flair for refined rapping and smooth movements in dancing.\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0  Rona\u2019s visual appeal is simply out of this world. She has a stage presence that dazzles, which shines twice as brightly alongside her overall stability as a performer. Watching her fancam gives you a glimpse of her duality as someone so delicate-looking managing to hold her own. Overall, Rona feels like she\u2019s just brimming with joyful energy, and it translates well into her execution of their song.\u00a0 \u00a0  In Japanese, Rei\u2019s name means loveliness and gracefulness. She embodies these very traits at her very core, delivering each performance with sharp movements and on-point expressions. Her \u2018LOVE DIVE\u2019 fancam calls attention to her unique style and impeccable self-control. While this era may depict her as cool and composed, there\u2019s much to look forward to.\u00a0 \u00a0 51 New K-Pop Groups Set To Debut In 2022 "

Because they couldn\u2019t see what\u2019s in front of them? Because their hearts turned cold? No, rather, they loved each other so much that they broke up. YeonDu is trying to push HyunHo away by holding her heart together while HyunHo tries to change YeonDu's mind somehow. On top of that, two new \u201cdisturbers\u201d start to come between the two. Now the story of the early days of University begins as they leave Hwayang High School behind and become real adults. \u00a0 Cast KOKTV Lee EunJae\u00a0as Kim YeonDoo She and her boyfriend HyunHo were a famous couple in high school but things are changing now that they are college students. It's not her heart that\u2019s changed but the situation\u2026 YeonDu, who is trying to pull herself together as the second semester begins while hanging out with new people, keeps thinking of HyunHo. There is a conflict between HyunHo, who is always hanging around YeonDu and, YeSeok, a kind Sunbae that helped YeonDu when she was in trouble. \u00a0 KOKTV Kang Yul\u00a0as Ji HyunHo Two years ago, HyunHo made a decision. Without getting caught up in feelings of inferiority or qualifications, he will become a man suitable for YeonDu and stand by her side. To do that, he had to go to college. \u00a0Now he is working hard in college, dreaming of becoming a chef. However, he actually lost YeonDu. He doesn\u2019t know where the hell it went wrong or what made YeonDu so difficult. But he can't break up like this! So HyunHo will once again approach YeonDu with all his heart. \u00a0 KOKTV EPEX's Keum as Kang AhHun After attending high school with YeonDu as her hoobae and living in the same building as her, AhHun developed a kind of student-teacher relationship with her. He started receiving tutoring from YeonDu in order to achieve his dream of attending Jua University. Why? Because SeungHyun Hyung is there! As a result of tutoring with YeonDu, he sometimes bumps into YuNa. \u00a0 KOKTV DAY6's WonPil as Do YeSeok He maintains a calm attitude as a good-looking, smart, and rational person who is not swept away by emotions. But his expression hardens as soon as he talks about just one person. \"Jin SeHee.\" He loved her like crazy but was alone in his deep feelings for her and ended up in an unbalanced relationship.\u00a0 He is a person who looks hard on the outside but is full of wounds on the inside. Perhaps that's why the phrase 'think moderately' is ingrained in his body. But after meeting YeonDu, it's not enough. He keeps crossing the line and becoming greedy. \u00a0 KOKTV Former IZ*ONE's Kang HyeWon as Jin SeHee Hwayang University goddess and object of envy. She earned a scholarship from a school that\u2019s difficult to get into and secured an internship abroad. She and YeSeok were the \u201cCampus Couple\u201d. However, SeHee became engulfed in ambition and broke up with YeSeok.\u00a0 After returning to school her plan is to get back with YeSeok, so she joins the same club as him. The more she tries to get closer to YeSeok again, she catches YeonDu flirting with him\u2026 While wandering between low self-esteem and unnecessarily high self-esteem, she plans to give YeonDu a hard time. \u00a0 KOKTV CIX's HyunSuk\u00a0as Kim DaeYoung DaeYoung is a university student in the Department of Business Administration. He is the true best friend of YeSeok. They are taking classes in the same department and even went to mandatory military service together. He is bright, positive, and sociable.\u00a0 For YeSeok who is interested in YeonDu, he becomes YeSeok\u2019s helper that creates opportunities for the two of them to connect. Although he went to the military at the age of twenty-three, he still believes in fate and is waiting for a movie-like meeting with his true love. But he thinks he found it. His destiny..! It is none other than Seol from the School of Design. \u00a0 KOKTV Park EHyun as Ryu Seol She entered the same university as YeonDu through the selection of her artistic talents. Still, her personality is cool and hot, and her remarkably beautiful appearance is the same. She thought she was doing fine except for JuHo not being by her side... Suddenly Seo JuHo appeared!\u00a0 In addition to that, she has been involved in a love triangle that was created unintentionally. Even with newcomer DaeYoung, who is constantly around, she\u2019ll make sure of things herself. Specifically JuHo's feelings towards her, and her feelings towards Juho...! \u00a0 KOKTV Yoon JunWon as Seo JuHo To JuHo all adults are liars! They tell him to do whatever he wants if he goes to college. But when he came back home after dropping out, he was kicked out. He has no choice but to live with HyunHo, who is on his own. He thought it would be cool to make a comeback in front of Seol, but he ends up in a competition with DaeYoung. The situation went from a love variety show to a survival show. But he won\u2019t give up! He is the person Seol crossed a continent for, after all! \u00a0 KOKTV Choe ChanYi as Jung JiSung JiSung is the only one of his friends who couldn\u2019t get into college. But, this won\u2019t break him! It was okay to take the college entrance exam bravely, but as he took the exam, he kept thinking that he is different from his college friends.\u00a0 Campus photos, meetings, sports day... Whenever posts related to college life are posted on friends' SNS, JiSung's sense of alienation deepens. Still, he is getting tutored by YeonDu along with AhHun. He will definitely go to college this time. Please! \u00a0 KOKTV Lee JungJun as Choi SeungHyun He was a high school baseball prospect that was talked about not only in domestic professional baseball but also in the major leagues. But due to a serious injury in the final tournament of high school, he decided to play for a college baseball team.\u00a0 Now, he is preparing for a comeback and training hard. He has opened his heart to YuNa, who sincerely supports and cares for him. He has a huge crush on YuNa, but is suppressing his love cells as much as possible to focus on training. \"I have no intention of dating. So don't do this to me and find someone else.\" \u00a0 KOKTV Ju HyunYoung as Ahn YuNa She thought she failed the college entrance exam\u2026fortunately she entered Jua University with an additional pass. She didn\u2019t know Choi SeungHyun would be going to the same university though! Her unrequited love, which was temporarily shut down, will resume operations immediately and she will approach SeungHyun more actively than before. She will comfortably go all-in on SeungHyun... But why is Kang AhHun following us around so much? \u201cYou work hard because you like baseball. Because I like you, I will work hard to express my feelings for you.\u201d \u00a0 KOKTV woo!ah! Nana as Ara She repented for her past atrocities and joined the group a little later, and now she is building a real friendship with everyone. Except for one...! The decision she made in the past to use JiSung's heart, who liked her sincerely, keeps bothering her.\u00a0 Is this feeling guilt, disappointment, or did she have real feelings for him? Still, she is holding back. When she finishes the college entrance exam she wants to have a drink alone with JiSung. Just the two of them. \u00a0 Poster & Teaser Here is one of the teasers.

Members Wish, Mu, Jeff, Ayden, Keum, AMin, YeWang, and BaekSeung are back just 4 months after their debut with a completely different concept. They are ready to show us the skills that they have developed and prove themselves once more. EPEX released their first teaser for 'Do 4 Me' on Oct. 15, which features a lot of cats and social media motifs as the boys ask you what you're going to do for them.  \"BIPOLAR Pt. 2: Prelude of Love\" has 4 tracks on it. The first song is called 'Love Virus' and has a funky and catchy melody as a hip hop song that will put you in a good mood. The second track is the title song 'Do 4 Me' with a funk-pop rhythm and bright energy. The EPEX members said that they hope fans can enjoy the lively performance that accompanies the song.\u00a0 The third track is 'Breathtaking' which has a powerful beat and is a pop song about a girl's first heartbreak. The final song '\uc9c0\uad6c\ubcc4 \uc5ec\ud589\uc790 (Traveller)' is about experiencing the world's wonders through a piano melody.\u00a0 C9 Entertainment EPEX held an online media showcase that Kpopmap was invited to and shared more about the album. Here is everything you need to know. This album was different not only because of the polar opposite concept but also because the members in the rap line participated more in the vocals. EPEX shared that they hope to become a holistic group where members can shine in different areas regardless of their position. When talking about the title track, they described 'Do 4 Me' as a cute and loveable confession song that expresses a modern love story through social media motifs, such as waiting for a text back from the person you like.\u00a0 You can watch the full music video here.  During the Q&A session, we got to know more about this comeback and what it means to the members.\u00a0 Kpopmap asked EPEX: How did the feeling of preparing for your first comeback compare to the feeling when you debuted? What was the biggest difference? We can show a more developed side of ourselves and we came back with a brighter concept. It is also no longer just the 8 of us showing ourselves to fans, but us making a comeback together with ZENITH (their fandom). Keum \u00a0 Your first album was \"Prelude of Anxiety\" and the second one is \"Prelude of Love\". What transition do you think has happened between the two albums? How do you feel you have developed musically since your debut? \u00a0 We have moved from anxious feelings in the first album to the feelings of first love in the second one. We thought a lot about how to express that. We also show a brighter side of ourselves through a happier sound.AMin \u00a0 The EPEX members definitely suit the brighter concept that they are going for. Just looking at the colors that certain members have died their hair makes us feel happy already. That happiness is sure to be doubled when you listen to the album, too! C9 Entertainment Lastly, EPEX expressed the nickname that they would like to gain as a group, as a sentence. \"I wonder what their next album will be like?\" They want to become a group that makes people curious about what they do next.\u00a0 They're already off to a good start with \"BIPOLAR Pt. 2: Prelude of Love\".

            "content": "K-Pop idols have always had more than their musicality and dancing skills to offer to the table. One of these skills is knowing another language. Since fans could feel more connected to someone fluent in their native tongue, it could help a group build a fanbase overseas. Other than English, Japanese is probably the most common language for K-Pop idols to be fluent in, especially since there are so many K-Pop idols from Japan. However, there are some idols with no connection to Japan who've reached an impressive level of proficiency in the language by learning it themselves. In no particular order, let's take a look at some of the newer idols who've studied or taught themselves Japanese! \u00a0 ENHYPEN's Twitter At a fansign, when asked by an ENGENE if he had any secrets for learning Japanese, Jay said that he started learning Japanese by watching the anime series 'Atashin'chi' and 'Detective Conan.' He also said that would listen to Japanese radio stations on YouTube with subtitles on. Prior to being an \"I-LAND\" contestant, he was a trainee for about 3 years, and during this time, he continued listening to Japanese radio with his earphones. His favorite Japanese word is \"tsuyoi,\" which means strong. It was also the first vocabulary word that he learned. As he was born in and spent much of his childhood living in Seattle, he's also fluent in English. \u00a0 CRAVITY's Twitter Since he was so into anime, WonJin started teaching himself Japanese so that he could watch it without subtitles. After joining Starship, he actually began taking Japanese lessons. At the 2020 Mnet Asian Music Awards, WonJin delivered an appreciation speech to fans in Japanese. People seemed to love his Japanese. He gained much attention for it on Twitter, and some viewers even mistook him for a Japanese member because his Japanese was so good.

            "title": "Bias Duality: Kep1er's Bahiyyih Is The 4th Generation Princess Of Our Dreams",
            "content": "Welcome to the thirty-sixth article of Kpopmap's weekly series exploring the amazing duality of K-Pop idols, actors, models, and more! Every week, we shine the spotlight on one artist who embodies the very essence of duality and has mastered the flair of harnessing their multifaceted talent to create the most brilliant art we have ever seen. You can click here\u00a0to check out all our Bias Duality articles in one place! This week's \"Bias Duality\" article is dedicated to a bright, young woman who livened up the K-Pop scene like a refreshing wind of change, inspiring millions to reach for the stars. We're talking about none other than Kep1er's Bahiyyih, the resident Princess of the 4th generation of K-Pop, crowned by the love and admiration of fans all over the world. Dazed Huening Bahiyyih, or Bahiyyih as she likes to be called, debuted as a member of Kep1er on January 3, 2022, after a successful run in the survival reality program \"Girls Planet 999\". During her stint at \"Girls Planet 999\", not only was Bahiyyih able to showcase her talent and more importantly, her potential but she also set an incredible example as an individual who put kindness, friendship, and compassion before anything else. As a matter of fact, it didn't take us long to realize that this lovely human right here was the real-life version of every strong fictional female character we adored as children and an even more potent role model for the youth. Kep1er's Twitter Bahiyyih epitomizes the unwavering optimism of Sailor Moon but also her courageous fighting spirit: qualities that defined her \"Girls Planet 999\" journey. Like Aurora and Tiana, Bahiyyih is driven by curiosity, ambition, and a strong sense of self, leading her to try new things and pursue her dreams with zest. She even mentioned in her \"99 PR\" video that she enjoys doing things she didn't know how to do before. Sparkle Bahiyyih Bahiyyih's got a little bit of modern Cinderella in her too, with how hard-working and passionate she is towards her art. That's not all! One simply cannot forget how, like Barbie, Bahiyyih too is living proof that you can be anything you want to be in life. Finally, Bahiyyih's visual and moral resemblance to Belle is simply uncanny! Both are highly intelligent, fiercely protective of their loved ones, and selflessly nurturing. Kep1er's Twitter TXT's TaeHyun once revealed on a T:TIME video that Bahiyyih had saved up her entire allowance to buy a phone for her brother Huening Kai so that he could use it for his selfies. It's no wonder that her older sister Lea (YouTuber, influencer, former member of VIVA), considers Bahiyyih the most caring out of the 3 siblings. It was her genuine warmth and thoughtfulness towards her fellow contestants that earned Bahiyyih the nickname \"Happy Virus\". 302degree Throughout the competition, Bahiyyih comforted others even when she herself was having a hard time, heartily congratulated those who deserved applause and humbly accepted criticism to become the best version of herself. Having ranked 2nd on the show overall, Bahiyyih stood before the world with dreams in her eyes, and her sincerity was reciprocated manifold by Kep1ians who saw in her a star that could give true meaning to the word \"idol\". So, now when she goes on stage, transforming from the girl next door to a global superstar, fans cannot help but look on with fondness, pride, and joy. The first kind of duality we encounter in Bahiyyih, therefore, is her ability to create a distinct stage persona that thrives on artistic expression. Mnet The way Bahiyyih commands the stage, adores and respects it, shows in her performance. The fire in her heart translates into an enchanting stage presence, making fans fall in love with her at first sight. What takes her talent to the next level is the charisma and confidence she imbues it with, and that is precisely what her X factor is all about. You just can't take your eyes off of Bahiyyih!  Like a seasoned actor, Bahiyyih can express the worldview of any song by getting into the character that best fits the same, giving the audience a fresh experience every time. This is where we find the second type of duality in Bahiyyih: her multidimensional performance. Mnet  Mnet  Mnet Mnet mbc MBC MBC MBC No matter how easy idols make it look, maintaining the correct facial expression on stage is truly underrated in terms of difficulty. It takes hours, days, and sometimes years of practice to be able to deliver expressions naturally, let alone switch things up on a whim. Needless to say, Bahiyyih has done the work, and the results are self-evident.    Finally, the third kind of duality Bahiyyih boasts of is in the range of visual aesthetics she can pull off with ease. Be it rocker chic, cottagecore, street-style, or high-teen, Bahiyyih is well-suited for it all. CHARMANDER8 CHARMANDER8 When these three dualities come together, we see Bahiyyih going from \"baby\" mode to \"queen\" mode in no time, whether that be on or off the stage.    The abundance of creative wealth that Bahiyyih is constantly honing so as to expand as an artist speaks volumes of the bright future she has ahead of her, especially since she is only getting started. We cannot wait to see what Bahiyyih has in store for us next.  What is your favourite part about Bahiyyih's duality? Tell us in the comments section down below!
